In this work, we apply it to a task we define as Time-Step Classification, where the goal is to classify individual time steps within a time series. Our approach demonstrates its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in this domain.--DIVIDER--\n# Abstract\nTime series analysis often requires classifying individual time points, a task we term Time-Step Classification. This publication explores the application of Distance Profile, an existing versatile technique in time series analysis, to this challenge. We adapt the Distance Profile method, using MASS (Mueen's Algorithm for Similarity Search) for efficient computation, specifically for Time-Step Classification. Our approach leverages the intuitive concept of nearest neighbor search to classify each time step based on similar sequences. We present our implementation, including modifications for multivariate time series, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on diverse datasets. While not achieving the highest accuracy compared to complex models like LightGBM, this adapted method proves valuable as a strong baseline and quick prototyping tool. This work aims to highlight Distance Profile as a simple yet versatile approach for Time-Step Classification, encouraging its broader adoption in practical time series analysis.--DIVIDER--# Introduction\nTime series data is ubiquitous, from stock prices to sensor readings, but analyzing it presents unique challenges. One such challenge is Time-Step Classification - labeling each point in a time series. While many complex methods exist, sometimes the most intuitive approaches yield impressive results.\n\nIn this paper, we explore Distance Profile, a method rooted in the simple concept of nearest neighbor search. We show how this straightforward idea becomes a powerful tool for Time-Step Classification:\n1. We introduce Distance Profile and its applications in time series analysis.\n2. We detail our implementation using the MASS algorithm, including adaptations for multivariate time series.\n3. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various datasets.\n\nBy showcasing how this simple, intuitive method can tackle complex time series challenges, we aim to highlight its value for establishing baselines and quick prototyping. Our work serves as a practical guide, encouraging practitioners to consider Distance Profile alongside more advanced techniques in their analytical toolkit.\n--DIVIDER--# Distance Profile\nDistance Profile is a fundamental technique in time series analysis that measures the similarity between a query subsequence and all possible subsequences of a longer time series. This method is crucial for various tasks such as pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and classification in time series data.\n\n## Definition\nThe distance profile of a query subsequence $Q$ with respect to a time series $T$ is a vector where each element represents the distance between $Q$ and a corresponding subsequence of  $T$. Formally:\n\n- Let  $T$ be a time series of length $n$.\n- Let $Q$ be a query subsequence of length $m$.\n- The distance profile  $D$ is an$(n-m+1)$ length vector.\n- Each element  $D[i]$ represents the distance between $Q$ and the subsequence of  $T$ starting at index $i$.\n\n## Computation\n\nThe most commonly used distance measure for calculating the distance profile is the z-normalized Euclidean distance, which is robust against variations in scale and offset. The computation involves two key steps:\n\n1. **Z-Normalization**: Each subsequence of the time series $T$ and the query $Q$ is individually normalized to have zero mean and unit variance. <br/>\n2. **Distance Computation**: The Euclidean distance between the normalized $Q$ and each normalized subsequence of $T$ is calculated and stored in the distance profile vector. <br/>\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\nWhile z-normalized Euclidean distance is common, other distance metrics can be used, such as cosine similarity, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance. The choice of metric can be treated as a tunable hyperparameter, optimized for the specific requirements of the downstream task.\n:::--DIVIDER--## Distance Profile Example\n**Sample Dataset for Demonstration**\nTo illustrate the application of Distance Profile in Time-Step Classification, we will use a real-world time series representing daily weather data for the city of Los Angeles. This dataset spans three full years, from 2020 to 2022, and includes various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.\n\nWe chose this dataset for its accessibility and clear seasonal patterns, making it ideal for demonstrating how Distance Profile identifies similar patterns across different time periods. Later in the experiments section, we will work with more typical, complex datasets to thoroughly evaluate the method's performance.\n\nThe dataset is uploaded in the **Resources** section of this article. See file titled `los_angeles_weather.csv`. We will use the feature series titled `maxTemp` for our demonstration.\n\nBelow is the plot of the daily maximum temperature in Los Angeles over the three years. It illustrates the distinct temperature patterns and seasonal fluctuations in the city, providing a rich dataset for analyzing time-series patterns.--DIVIDER--\n![los_angeles_maxtemp_2020_2022.png](los_angeles_maxtemp_2020_2022.png)--DIVIDER--**Query Subsequence**\nThe dataset provides an excellent example for demonstrating how Distance Profile can identify similar patterns within a time series. For our demonstration, we select a query period representing the first 10 days in the dataset (i.e., starting on January 1st and ending on January 10th, 2020.) The following chart shows the maximum temperatures over the query period.\n\nThe following chart shows the maximum temperatures over the query period.--DIVIDER--\n![query_period_maxtemp_2020.png](query_period_maxtemp_2020.png)--DIVIDER--The goal of this example is to identify other similar temperature patterns throughout the three-year period using Distance Profile. By applying Distance Profile to this query subsequence, we can explore how well the technique can locate similar temperature trends within the broader time series. This exercise not only showcases the practical utility of Distance Profile but also demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying meaningful patterns in real-world weather data. <br/>--DIVIDER--**Implementation using NumPy** \nThe following code is a simple implementation of the distance profile algorithm on a one-dimensional series.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef z_normalize(ts):\n    \"\"\"Z-normalize a time series.\"\"\"\n    return (ts - np.mean(ts)) / np.std(ts)\n\ndef sliding_window_view(arr, window_size):\n    \"\"\"Generate a sliding window view of the array.\"\"\"\n    return np.lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view(arr, window_size)\n\ndef distance_profile(query, ts):\n    \"\"\"Compute the distance profile of a query within a time series.\"\"\"\n    query_len = len(query)\n    ts_len = len(ts)\n\n    # Z-normalize the query\n    query = z_normalize(query)\n\n    # Generate all subsequences of the time series\n    subsequences = sliding_window_view(ts, query_len)\n\n    # Z-normalize the subsequences individually\n    subsequences = np.apply_along_axis(z_normalize, 1, subsequences)\n\n    # Compute the distance profile\n    distances = np.linalg.norm(subsequences - query, axis=1)\n\n    return distances\n\n# You can now apply the above functions to your temperature data\n# by passing the relevant query and time series arrays.\n\n# Compute the distance profile\ndist_profile = distance_profile(query, time_series)\n```--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Note\"}\nThis numpy code provided above is for illustration purposes. For a more efficient implementation, use `matrixprofile` or `stumpy` python packages.\n\nThe package `stumpy` offers Mueen\u2019s Algorithm for Similarity Search (MASS) for fast and scalable distance profile. Using it, the code simplifies as follows:\n\n```python\nimport stumpy\n\n# ... read your data and create the query and time_series numpy arrays\n# query is a 1d numpy array\n# time_series is a 1d numpy array\n\ndistance_profile = stumpy.core.mass(query, time_series)\n\n```\n:::--DIVIDER--The following chart displays the distance profile for the given query and time_series. The 3 nearest-neighbors are time-windows starting on May 29th, 2020, December 3rd, 2020, and May 30th, 2021. These are the locations in the time series where the distance profile values are the lowest, indicating the most similar subsequences to the query.--DIVIDER--\n![distance_profile.png](distance_profile.png)--DIVIDER--Next, we visualize and compare the patterns in the 3 nearest neighbors with the original query in the following chart.--DIVIDER--\n![query_and_neighbors_2x2.png](query_and_neighbors_2x2.png)--DIVIDER--We can observe the similarities between the query and its nearest neighbors. The query time series shows a slight upward trend during the first 6 days, followed by a downward trend over the next 4 days. The three nearest neighbors exhibit similar patterns, effectively capturing the essence of the query subsequence.\n\nIt may seem surprising that the nearest neighbors to the query period from January 1st to January 10th, 2020, are not all from the same time of year (winter). In fact, two of the nearest neighbors fall in late May and early June. For example, while the average temperature during the query period is 19.8\u00b0C, the nearest neighbor on May 29, 2020, has an average temperature of 26.6\u00b0C.\n\nThis occurs because both the subsequences and the query are z-normalized before calculating the distance profile. Z-normalization removes magnitude differences, allowing the distance profile to focus on the shape of the temperature curve rather than the absolute values. This approach enables the identification of similar patterns in the data, regardless of differences in scale or offset.--DIVIDER--## MASS and STUMPY\nDistance Profile involves calculating the distance between a query subsequence and all possible subsequences within a time series. While the basic concept can be implemented using NumPy, as shown above, this approach can become computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.\n\nTo address this, Mueen's Algorithm for Similarity Search (MASS) was developed as an optimized and highly efficient method for computing the distance profile. MASS leverages the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to significantly speed up the computation, making it well-suited for large-scale time series data. Essentially, MASS is a fast implementation of the Distance Profile algorithm, providing the same results but with much greater efficiency.\n\nBy using the `stumpy` package, which implements MASS, we can achieve scalable and rapid distance profile, enabling its use in real-world applications where performance and speed are critical.--DIVIDER--\n## Multi-Dimensional Distance Profile\n\nThe concept of distance profile can be extended to multivariate time series data, where each time point consists of multiple features or channels. This extension is crucial for performing similarity searches on multivariate time series, a common requirement in many real-world applications where data is collected across multiple channels simultaneously.\n\nTo compute a multi-dimensional distance profile, we can take one of two approaches:\n1. **Summing Individual Distance Profiles**: Calculate the distance profile for each feature separately and then sum them to form a multi-dimensional distance profile. <br/>\n2. **Direct Multivariate Euclidean Distance**: Compute the multivariate Euclidean distance directly across all features. <br/>\n\nIn our work, we opted for the first approach\u2014summing the distance profiles of individual features. We acknowledge that this choice was somewhat arbitrary, and the impact of this decision on the results could be an interesting area for further exploration.\n\nWe utilized Mueen\u2019s Algorithm for Similarity Search (MASS) to calculate the multi-dimensional matrix profile. Here\u2019s how you can implement this approach:\n\n```python\ndef multi_dimensional_mass(\n        query_subsequence: np.ndarray,\n        time_series: np.ndarray\n    ) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the multi-dimensional matrix profile.\n\n    Args:\n        query_subsequence (np.ndarray): The query subsequence.\n        time_series (np.ndarray): The time series.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The multi-dimensional matrix profile.\n    \"\"\"\n    for dim in range(time_series.shape[1]):\n        if dim == 0:\n            profile = stumpy.core.mass(\n                query_subsequence[:, dim], time_series[:, dim]\n            )\n        else:\n            profile += stumpy.core.mass(\n                query_subsequence[:, dim], time_series[:, dim]\n            )\n    return profile\n```\n--DIVIDER--\n# Time-Step Classification\n\nTime-step classification is a challenging task in time series analysis, where the goal is to assign a label to each individual time point within a sequence. This type of classification is crucial in various real-world applications, where the temporal dynamics of the data play a significant role in understanding and predicting outcomes.\n\nThe following are a couple of examples where time-step classification is applied:\n1. **Human Activity Recognition**: In wearable technology and smart devices, time-step classification is used to identify and categorize human activities such as walking, running, or sitting, based on sensor data collected over time. Each time step in the sensor data corresponds to a specific activity label, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis. <br/>\n2. **ECG Signal Classification**: In medical diagnostics, time-step classification is applied to ECG signals to detect and classify heartbeats as normal or indicative of various arrhythmias. Each time step in the ECG signal represents a moment in the cardiac cycle, and correctly labeling these steps is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment. <br/>--DIVIDER--## Problem Definition\n\nTime-step classification involves assigning a label to each time step within a sequence, whether the data is univariate or multivariate. The dataset for this task typically includes the following characteristics:\n\n- **Input Features**: The data consists of time series, which can be either univariate (single feature) or multivariate (multiple features).\n- **Label Assignment**: For each time step, a specific label needs to be assigned, indicating the class or category of that particular time point.\n- **Training and Inference Data**:\n  - **Training Data**: Contains sequences that are fully labeled, providing the model with both the input features and the corresponding labels.\n  - **Test (Inference) Data**: Contains sequences without labels, where the model needs to predict the label for each time step.\n- **Multiple Samples**: The dataset may include multiple sequences, each representing different instances or subjects. For example, in Human Activity Recognition (HAR), each sequence might correspond to a different person performing various activities, with labels indicating the specific activity at each time step.\n- **Variable Sequence Lengths**: The length of sequences can vary across both training and test data, meaning that each sample may have a different number of time steps.\n\nOur goal is to train a model on the labeled training data so that it learns to accurately assign labels to each time step in the test data.--DIVIDER--## Distance Profile for Time-Step Classification\nIn this section, we explore how the Distance Profile technique, particularly through Mueen\u2019s Algorithm for Similarity Search (MASS), can be adapted and applied to the task of time-step classification. By calculating the distance profile for each time step, we can effectively classify individual time points within a time series, enabling more precise and informed analysis across various domains.\n\nThe general approach is as follows:\n1. **Subsequence Querying**: For each sequence in the test dataset, we break it down into smaller subsequences, or \"queries.\" Each query represents a window of time steps within the sequence that we want to classify. <br/>\n2. **Finding Nearest Neighbors**: For each query, we calculate its distance profile against the training dataset, identifying its k-nearest neighbors\u2014subsequences in the training data that most closely match the query in terms of shape and pattern.  <br/>\n3. **Label Assignment**: The labels of these k-nearest neighbors are then used to assign a label to each time step in the query. This allows us to classify each time point in the test sequence based on the most similar patterns observed in the labeled training data.  <br/>\n--DIVIDER--## Implementation Details\nTo adapt the MASS algorithm for Time-Step Classification, we made several key modifications to effectively handle the nuances of this task. These modifications ensure that the algorithm can accurately classify each time step in the test data by leveraging the labeled training data. Below are the critical components of our implementation:\n\n**Windows**\nEach sequence (i.e. sample) in the test data is divided into smaller windows to create the subsequences (queries) that will be classified. The window length is a tunable parameter, determined as a function of the minimum sequence length in the training data. This approach allows us to capture relevant patterns while maintaining consistency across varying sequence lengths.\n\n**Strides**\nTo ensure comprehensive coverage of the test data, we allow overlapping windows to be created. The degree of overlap is controlled by a stride factor, enabling us to balance between computational efficiency and the thoroughness of the classification.\n\n**Distance Profile Calculation**\nFor each window in the test data, we compute the distance profile over all subsequences from all samples in the training data. This is done using the MASS algorithm, which calculates the Euclidean distance on z-normalized data for each feature. The final distance measure for each subsequence is obtained by summing the distances across all features, ensuring that all aspects of the multivariate time series are considered.\n\n**k-Nearest Neighbors**\nOnce the distance profile is calculated for each window in the test data, we identify the k-nearest neighbors from the training data based on the computed distances. These neighbors represent the most similar windows in the training set. The labels associated with these neighbors, which are one-hot encoded, are extracted for further processing.\n\n**Averaging Labels**\nA single time step in the test data may appear in multiple query windows, and for each window, we have k-nearest neighbors subsequences from the training data. To determine the final label for each time step index _i_ within a query, we average the labels from corresponding index _i_ across all the neighbor subsequences. This approach produces a set of label probabilities, from which the most likely label is assigned to the time step.\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\nThe complete implementation of our approach is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/readytensor/rt_tspc_distance_profile). It is also linked in the **Models** section of this publication. \n\nThe implementation is designed in a generalized way, allowing users to easily apply it to their own datasets. Additionally, the implementation is dockerized for convenience, though users can also run it locally if they prefer. The implementation leverages the STUMPY library.\n:::--DIVIDER--## Limitations of the Approach\n\nWhile the Distance Profile method for Time-Step Classification offers simplicity and interpretability, it has several limitations:\n\n- **Computational Expense**: For large datasets, calculating distance profiles can be computationally intensive, potentially limiting scalability.\n- **Local Pattern Focus**: Predictions depend entirely on the k-nearest neighbors identified. If these neighbors contain noisy/anomalous data (in features or labels), it can lead to noisy predictions.\n- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Results can be sensitive to the choice of distance metric and the number of nearest neighbors ($k$), requiring careful tuning.\n- **Computational Burden During Inference**: Unlike models that learn during a training phase, this method performs all its computations during the inference phase. This can lead to slower predictions on large datasets compared to other complex models which, though potentially slow to train, are typically quick to make predictions once trained.\n\nThese limitations should be considered when applying this approach, particularly for large-scale or complex time series classification tasks.--DIVIDER--# Experiments\nWe tested the distance profile algorithm for time-step classification on five benchmarking datasets: EEG Eye State, HAR70+, HMM Continuous (synthetic), Occupancy Detection, and PAMAP2. These datasets, along with additional information about them, are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/readytensor/rt_datasets_time_step_classification), which is also linked in the **Datasets** section of this publication.--DIVIDER--\n## Evaluation Results\n\nThe performance of the distance profile model was evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, weighted and macro precision, weighted and macro recall, weighted and macro F1-score, and weighted AUC. The results for each dataset are summarized in the table below:\n\n| Dataset Name                        | Accuracy | Weighted Precision | Macro Precision | Weighted Recall | Macro Recall | Weighted F1-score | Macro F1-score | Weighted AUC Score |\n| ----------------------------------- | :------: | :----------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :----------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :----------------: |\n| EEG Eye State                       |  0.611   |       0.869        |      0.545      |      0.611      |    0.628     |       0.718       |     0.584      |       0.625        |\n| HAR70+                              |  0.641   |        0.64        |      0.47       |      0.641      |    0.369     |       0.641       |     0.414      |       0.742        |\n| HMM Continuous Timeseries Dataset   |  0.641   |       0.614        |      0.594      |      0.641      |    0.552     |       0.627       |     0.572      |       0.818        |\n| Occupancy Detection                 |  0.893   |       0.892        |      0.885      |      0.893      |    0.834     |       0.893       |     0.859      |       0.972        |\n| PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring |  0.616   |       0.657        |      0.681      |      0.616      |    0.606     |       0.636       |     0.641      |       0.929        |\n\nAs is common in benchmarking studies, we observe varying performance across different datasets. This variation likely reflects the inherent predictability of each dataset rather than specific strengths or weaknesses of the Distance Profile method. All models, including more complex ones, typically face similar patterns of relative difficulty across datasets. \n\nNext, we compare the results of the Distance Profile model with those of LightGBM, a top-performing model in a comparative analysis conducted by this publication.--DIVIDER--\n## Comparison with LightGBM\n\nFor comparison, we now present the results from one of the top-performing model, LightGBM, from a comparative analysis conducted in this publication. \n--DIVIDER--| Dataset   Name                        | Accuracy | Weighted Precision | Macro Precision | Weighted Recall | Macro Recall | Weighted F1-score | Macro F1-score | Weighted AUC Score |\n|---------------------------------------|:--------:|:------------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:|:------------------:|\n| EEG   Eye State                       |   0.458  |        0.857       |      0.523      |      0.458      |     0.566    |       0.597       |      0.544     |        0.581       |\n| HAR70+                                |   0.862  |        0.87        |       0.55      |      0.862      |     0.496    |       0.866       |      0.522     |        0.859       |\n| HMM   Continuous Timeseries Dataset   |   0.876  |        0.875       |      0.868      |      0.876      |     0.85     |       0.876       |      0.859     |        0.974       |\n| Occupancy   Detection                 |   0.996  |        0.996       |      0.992      |      0.996      |     0.997    |       0.996       |      0.994     |        0.998       |\n| PAMAP2   Physical Activity Monitoring |   0.731  |        0.741       |      0.737      |      0.731      |     0.716    |       0.736       |      0.726     |        0.951       |\n--DIVIDER--**Note**: Detailed results for all models in the Time Step Classification benchmark are available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/readytensor/rt_tspc_lightgbm). --DIVIDER--The LightGBM model also shows performance variability across datasets, with a notable correlation to the Distance Profile method's results. For instance, both models achieve their highest performance on the Occupancy Detection dataset.\n\nOverall, LightGBM outperforms the Distance Profile method. The average of Macro Average F1-score for the Distance Profile model is 0.614, compared to 0.729 for LightGBM. This performance gap can be attributed to LightGBM's greater complexity and expressiveness, allowing it to capture more intricate data patterns than the simpler Distance Profile method.\n\nDespite not matching LightGBM's accuracy, the Distance Profile model remains valuable for establishing benchmarks and quick prototyping. We recommend using it as a reference point during the development of more sophisticated models.--DIVIDER--# Summary\nDistance Profile is a simple and versatile tool in time series data mining. It works by calculating the distance between a query subsequence and all other subsequences within a time series, forming the foundation for advanced analytical tasks.\n\nWe utilized Mueen's Algorithm for Similarity Search (MASS) for its efficiency and scalability, making it ideal for large real-world datasets. The process involves:\n\n- Z-normalizing the time series and query to manage scale variations.\n- Computing the Euclidean distance for each subsequence against the query.\n- Supporting both univariate and multivariate data for comprehensive analysis.\n\nWhile Distance Profile may not always achieve the highest accuracy compared to more complex models, it is invaluable for establishing strong baselines. Its simplicity and adaptability make it a must-have tool before advancing to more sophisticated methods.\n\nBeyond time-step classification, Distance Profile is also effective for anomaly detection, motif discovery, and time series segmentation.

This study comprehensively evaluates three widely-used strategies for handling class imbalance: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), Class Weights tuning, and Decision Threshold Calibration. We compare these methods against a baseline scenario across 15 diverse machine learning models and 30 datasets from various domains, conducting a total of 9,000 experiments. Performance was primarily assessed using the F1-score, with additional 9 metrics including F2-score, precision, recall, Brier-score, PR-AUC, and AUC. Our results indicate that all three strategies generally outperform the baseline, with Decision Threshold Calibration emerging as the most consistently effective technique. However, we observed substantial variability in the best-performing method across datasets, highlighting the importance of testing multiple approaches for specific problems. This study provides valuable insights for practitioners dealing with imbalanced datasets and emphasizes the need for dataset-specific analysis in evaluating class imbalance handling techniques.--DIVIDER--# Introduction\n\nBinary classification tasks frequently encounter imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outnumbers the other. This imbalance can severely impact model performance, often resulting in classifiers that excel at identifying the majority class but perform poorly on the critical minority class. In fields such as fraud detection, disease diagnosis, and rare event prediction, this bias can have serious consequences.\n\nOne of the most influential techniques developed to address this challenge is the **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)**, a method proposed by Chawla et al. (2002) that generates synthetic examples of the minority class. Since its introduction, the SMOTE paper has become one of the most cited papers in the field of imbalanced learning, with over 30,000 citations. SMOTE's popularity has spurred the creation of many other oversampling techniques and numerous SMOTE variants. For example, Kov\u00e1cs (2019) documents 85 SMOTE-variants implemented in Python, including:\n\n- **Borderline-SMOTE** (Han et al., 2005)\n- **Safe-Level-SMOTE** (Bunkhumpornpat et al., 2009)\n- **SMOTE + Tomek** and **SMOTE + ENN** (Batista et al., 2004)\n\nDespite its widespread use, recent studies have raised some criticisms of SMOTE. For instance, Blagus and Lusa (2013) indicate limitations in handling high-dimensional data, while Elor and Averbuch-Elor (2022) and Hulse et al. (2007) suggest the presence of better alternatives for handling class imbalance. This highlights that while SMOTE is a powerful tool, it is not without limitations.\n\nIn this study, we aim to provide a more balanced view of techniques for handling class imbalance by evaluating not only SMOTE but also other widely-used strategies, such as Class Weights and Decision Threshold Calibration. These three treatment scenarios target class imbalance at different stages of the machine learning pipeline:\n\n1. **SMOTE**: Generating synthetic examples of the minority class during data preprocessing.\n2. **Class Weights**: Adjusting the importance of classes during model training.\n3. **Decision Threshold Calibration**: Adjusting the classification threshold post-training.\n\nWe compare these strategies with the **Baseline** approach (standard model training without addressing imbalance) to assess their effectiveness in improving model performance on imbalanced datasets. Our goal is to provide insights into which treatment methods offer the most significant improvements in performance metrics such as F1-score, F2-score, accuracy, precision, recall, MCC, Brier score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), PR-AUC, and AUC. We also aim to evaluate these techniques across a wide range of datasets and models to provide a more generalizable understanding of their effectiveness.\n\nTo ensure a comprehensive evaluation, this study encompasses:\n\n- **30 datasets** from various domains, with sample sizes ranging from ~500 to 20,000 and rare class percentages between 1% and 20%.\n- **15 classifier models**, including tree-based methods, boosting algorithms, neural networks, and traditional classifiers.\n- Evaluation using 5-fold cross-validation.\n\nIn total, we conduct 9,000 experiments involving the 4 scenarios, 15 models, 30 datasets, and validation folds. This extensive approach allows us to compare these methods and their impact on model performance across a wide range of scenarios and algorithmic approaches. It provides a robust foundation for understanding the effectiveness of different imbalance handling strategies in binary classification tasks.--DIVIDER--# Methodology\n\n## Datasets\n\nWe selected 30 datasets based on the following criteria:\n\n- Binary classification problems\n- Imbalanced class distribution (minority class < 20%)\n- Sample size \u2264 20,000\n- Feature count \u2264 100\n- Real-world data from diverse domains\n- Publicly available\n\nThe characteristics of the selected datasets are summarized in the chart below:--DIVIDER--\n![datasets-summary.png](datasets-summary.png)--DIVIDER--\nThe dataset selection criteria were carefully chosen to ensure a comprehensive and practical study:\n\n- The 20% minority  class threshold for class imbalance, while somewhat arbitrary, represents a reasonable cut-off point that is indicative of significant imbalance.\n- The limitations on sample size (\u2264 20,000) and feature count (\u2264 100) were set to accommodate a wide range of real-world datasets while ensuring manageable computational resources for an experiment of our scale. This balance allows us to include diverse, practically relevant datasets without compromising the breadth of our study.\n- The focus on diverse domains ensures that our models are tested across a wide range of industries and data characteristics, enhancing the generalizability of our findings.\n--DIVIDER--\n:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n<h2> Dataset Repository </h2>\n\nYou can find the study datasets and information about their sources and specific characteristics in the following repository: \n\n[Imbalanced Classification Study Datasets](https://github.com/readytensor/rt-binary-imbalance-datasets)\n\nThis repository is also linked in the **Datasets** section of this publication.\n:::--DIVIDER--\n## Models\n\nOur study employed a diverse set of 15 classifier models, encompassing a wide spectrum of algorithmic approaches and complexities. This selection ranges from simple baselines to advanced ensemble methods and neural networks, including tree-based models and various boosting algorithms. The diversity in our model selection allows us to assess how different imbalanced data handling techniques perform across various model types and complexities.\n\nThe following chart lists the models used in our experiments:--DIVIDER--\n\n![classifiers.png](classifiers.png)--DIVIDER--A key consideration in our model selection process was ensuring that all four scenarios (Baseline, SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold Calibration) could be applied consistently to each model. This criterion influenced our choices, leading to the exclusion of certain algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes Classifiers, which do not inherently support the application of class weights. This careful selection process allowed us to maintain consistency across all scenarios while still representing a broad spectrum of machine learning approaches.\n--DIVIDER--\n<h2> Implementation Details </h2>\nEach model is implemented in a separate repository to accommodate differing dependencies, but all are designed to work with any dataset in a generalized manner. These repositories include:\n\n- Training and testing code\n- Docker containerization for environment-independent usage\n- Hyperparameter tuning code, where applicable\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, we used the same preprocessing pipeline for all 15 models and scenarios. This pipeline includes steps such as one-hot encoding, standard scaling, and missing data imputation. The only difference in preprocessing occurs in the SMOTE scenario, where synthetic minority class examples are generated. Otherwise, the preprocessing steps are identical across all models and scenarios, ensuring that the only difference is the algorithm and the specific imbalance handling technique applied.\n\nAdditionally, each model's hyperparameters were kept constant across the Baseline, SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold scenarios to ensure fair comparisons.\n\nThe imbalanced data handling scenarios are implemented in a branch named `imbalance`. A configuration file, `model_config.json`, allows users to specify which scenario to run: `baseline`, `smote`, `class_weights`, or `decision_threshold`.--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n<h2> Model Repositories </h2>\n\nAll model implementations are available in our public repositories, linked in the **Models** section of this publication.\n:::--DIVIDER--## Evaluation Metrics\n\nTo comprehensively evaluate the performance of the models across different imbalanced data handling techniques, we tracked the following 10 metrics:--DIVIDER--\n\n![evaluation-metrics.png](evaluation-metrics.png)--DIVIDER--\nOur primary focus is on the **F1-score**, a label metric that uses predicted classes rather than underlying probabilities. The F1-score provides a balanced measure of precision and recall, making it particularly useful for assessing performance on imbalanced datasets.\n\nWhile real-world applications often employ domain-specific cost matrices to create custom metrics, our study spans 30 diverse datasets. The F1-score allows us to evaluate all four scenarios, including decision threshold tuning, consistently across this varied set of problems.\n\nAlthough our analysis emphasizes the F1-score, we report results for all 10 metrics. Readers can find comprehensive information on model performance across all metrics and scenarios in the detailed results repository linked in the Datasets section of this publication.--DIVIDER--\n## Experimental Procedure\n\nOur experimental procedure was designed to ensure a robust and comprehensive evaluation of the four imbalance handling scenarios across diverse datasets and models. The process consisted of the following steps:\n\n<h2> Dataset Splitting </h2>\n\nWe employed a form of nested cross-validation for each dataset to ensure robust model evaluation and proper hyperparameter tuning:\n\n1. Outer Loop: 5-fold cross-validation\n\n   - Each dataset was split into five folds\n   - Results were reported for all five test splits, providing mean and standard deviation values across the folds\n\n2. Inner Validation: 90/10 train-validation split\n   - For scenarios requiring hyperparameter tuning (SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold Calibration), the training split from the outer loop was further divided into a 90% train and 10% validation split\n   - The validation split was used exclusively for tuning hyperparameters\n\nThis nested structure ensures that the test set from the outer loop remains completely unseen during both training and hyperparameter tuning, providing an unbiased estimate of model performance. The outer test set was reserved for final evaluation, while the inner validation set was used solely for hyperparameter optimization in the relevant scenarios.\n\n<h2> Scenario Descriptions </h2>\nWe evaluated four distinct scenarios for handling class imbalance:\n\n1. **Baseline**: This scenario involves standard model training without any specific treatment for class imbalance. It serves as a control for comparing the effectiveness of the other strategies.\n\n2. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: In this scenario, we apply SMOTE to the training data to generate synthetic examples of the minority class.\n\n3. **Class Weights**: This approach involves adjusting the importance of classes during model training, focusing on the minority class weight while keeping the majority class weight at 1.\n\n4. **Decision Threshold Calibration**: In this scenario, we adjust the classification threshold post-training to optimize the model's performance on imbalanced data.\n\nEach scenario implements only one treatment method in isolation. We do not combine treatments across scenarios. Specifically:\n\n- For scenarios 1, 2, and 3, we apply the default decision threshold of 0.5.\n- For scenarios 1, 2, and 4, the class weights are set to 1.0 for both positive and negative classes.\n- SMOTE is applied only in scenario 2, class weight adjustment only in scenario 3, and decision threshold calibration only in scenario 4.\n\nThis approach allows us to assess the individual impact of each treatment method on handling class imbalance.--DIVIDER--\n<h2> Hyperparameter Tuning </h2>\n\nFor scenarios requiring hyperparameter tuning (SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold), we employed a simple grid search strategy to maximize the F1-score measured on the single validation split (10% of the training data) for each fold.\n\nThe grid search details for the three treatment scenarios were as follows:\n\n<h3> SMOTE </h3>\nWe tuned the number of neighbors hyperparameter, performing a simple grid search over `k` values of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.  \n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3> Class Weights </h3>\nIn this scenario, we adjusted the class weights to handle class imbalance during model training. The tuning process involved adjusting the weight for the minority class relative to the majority class. If both classes were given equal weights (e.g., 1 and 1), no class imbalance handling was applied\u2014this corresponds to the baseline scenario. For the balanced scenario, we set the minority class weight proportional to the class imbalance (e.g., if the majority/minority class ratio was 5:1, the weight for the minority class would be 5). We conducted grid search on the following factors: 0 (baseline case), 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 (balanced), and 1.25 (over-correction). The optimal weight was selected based on the F1-score on the validation split.  \n<br/><br/>\n\n<h3> Decision Threshold Calibration </h3>\nWe tuned the threshold parameter from 0.05 to 0.5 with a step size of 0.05, allowing for a wide range of potential decision boundaries.  \n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\nThere are no scenario-specific hyperparameters to tune for the Baseline scenario. As a result, no train/validation split was needed, and the entire training set was used for model training.\n:::--DIVIDER--<h2> Overall Scope of Experiments </h2>\nOverall, this study contains 9,000 experiments driven by the following factors:\n\n- 30 datasets\n- 15 models\n- 4 scenarios\n- 5-fold cross-validation\n\nFor each experiment, we recorded the 10 performance metrics across the five test splits. In the following sections, we present the results of these extensive experiments.--DIVIDER--# Results\n\nThis section presents a comprehensive analysis of our experiments comparing four strategies for handling class imbalance in binary classification tasks. We begin with an overall comparison of the four scenarios (Baseline, SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold Calibration) across all ten evaluation metrics. Following this, we focus on the F1-score metric to examine performance across the 15 classifier models and 30 datasets used in our study.\n\nOur analysis is structured as follows:\n\n1. Overall performance comparison by scenario and metric\n2. Model-specific performance on F1-score\n3. Dataset-specific performance on F1-score\n4. Statistical analysis, including repeated measures tests and post-hoc pairwise comparisons\n\nFor the overall, model-specific, and dataset-specific analyses, we report mean performance and standard deviations across the five test splits from our cross-validation procedure. The final section presents the results of our statistical tests, offering a rigorous comparison of the four scenarios' effectiveness in handling class imbalance.\n--DIVIDER--## Overall Comparison\n\nFigure 1 presents the mean performance and standard deviation for all 10 evaluation metrics across the four scenarios: Baseline, SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold Calibration.--DIVIDER--\n![overall_results.svg](overall_results.svg)\n\n_Figure 1: Mean performance and standard deviation of evaluation metrics across all scenarios. Best values per metric are highlighted in blue._--DIVIDER--The results represent aggregated performance across all 15 models and 30 datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of each scenario in handling class imbalance.\n--DIVIDER--<h2> F1-Score Performance </h2>\n\nThe results show that all three class imbalance handling techniques outperform the Baseline scenario in terms of F1-score:\n\n1. Decision Threshold Calibration achieved the highest mean F1-score (0.617 \u00b1 0.005)\n2. SMOTE followed closely (0.605 \u00b1 0.006)\n3. Class Weights showed improvement over Baseline (0.594 \u00b1 0.006)\n4. Baseline had the lowest F1-score (0.556 \u00b1 0.006)\n\nThis suggests that addressing class imbalance, regardless of the method, generally improves model performance as measured by the F1-score.\n\n<h2> Other Metrics </h2>\n\nWhile our analysis primarily focuses on the F1-score, it's worth noting observations from the other metrics:\n\n- **F2-score and Recall**: Decision Threshold Calibration and SMOTE showed the highest performance, indicating these methods are particularly effective at improving the model's ability to identify the minority class.\n- **Precision**: The Baseline scenario achieved the highest precision, suggesting a more conservative approach in predicting the minority class.\n- **MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)**: SMOTE and Decision Threshold Calibration tied for the best performance, indicating a good balance between true and false positives and negatives.\n- **PR-AUC and AUC**: These metrics showed relatively small differences across scenarios. Notably, SMOTE and Class Weights did not deteriorate performance on these metrics compared to the Baseline. As expected, Decision Threshold Calibration, being a post-model adjustment, does not materially impact these probability-based metrics (as well as Brier-Score).\n- **Accuracy**: The Baseline scenario achieved the highest accuracy, which is common in imbalanced datasets where high accuracy can be achieved despite poor minority class detection.\n- **Log-Loss**: The Baseline scenario performed best, suggesting it produces the most well-calibrated probabilities. SMOTE showed the highest log-loss, indicating potential issues with probability calibration.\n- **Brier-Score**: As expected, the Baseline and Decision Threshold scenarios show identical performance, as Decision Threshold Calibration is a post-prediction adjustment and doesn't affect the underlying probabilities used in the Brier Score calculation. Notably, SMOTE performed significantly worse on this metric, indicating it produces poorly calibrated probabilities compared to the other scenarios.\n\nBased on these observations, Decision Threshold Calibration demonstrates strong performance across several key metrics, particularly those focused on minority class prediction (F1-score, F2-score, and Recall). It achieves this without compromising the calibration of probabilities of the baseline model, as evidenced by the identical Brier Score. In contrast, while SMOTE improves minority class detection, it leads to the least well-calibrated probabilities, as shown by its poor Brier Score. This suggests that Decision Threshold Calibration could be particularly effective in scenarios where accurate identification of the minority class is crucial, while still maintaining the probability calibration of the original model.\n\nFor the rest of this article, we will focus on the F1-score due to its balanced representation of precision and recall, which is particularly important in imbalanced classification tasks.\n--DIVIDER--\n## Results by Model\n\nFigure 2 presents the mean F1-scores and standard deviations for each of the 15 models across the four scenarios. Each model's scores are averaged across the 30 datasets.\n--DIVIDER--\n![by_model_f1_results.svg](by_model_f1_results.svg)\n_Figure 2: Mean F1-scores and standard deviations for each model across the four scenarios. Highest values per model are highlighted in blue._--DIVIDER--\nKey observations from these results include:\n\n1. **Scenario Comparison**: For each model, we compared the performance of the four scenarios (Baseline, SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold Calibration). This within-model comparison is more relevant than comparing different models to each other, given the diverse nature of the classifier techniques.  </br>\n\n2. **Decision Threshold Performance**: The Decision Threshold Calibration scenario achieved the highest mean F1-score in 10 out of 15 models. Notably, even when it wasn't the top performer, it consistently remained very close to the best scenario for that model.  </br>\n\n3. **Other Scenarios**: Within individual models, Class Weights performed best in 3 cases, while SMOTE and Baseline each led in 1 case.  </br>\n\n4. **Consistent Improvement**: All three imbalance handling techniques generally showed improvement over the Baseline scenario across most models, with 1 exception.  </br>\n\nThese results indicate Decision Threshold Calibration was most frequently the top performer across the 15 models. This suggests that post-model adjustments to the decision threshold is a robust strategy for improving model performance across different classifier techniques. However, the strong performance of other techniques in some cases underscores the importance of testing multiple approaches when dealing with imbalanced datasets in practice.\n--DIVIDER--\n## Results by Dataset\n\nFigure 3 presents the mean F1-scores and standard deviations for each of the 30 datasets across the four scenarios.--DIVIDER--\n![by_dataset_f1_results.svg](by_dataset_f1_results.svg)\n\n_Figure 3: Mean F1-scores and standard deviations for each dataset across the four scenarios. Highest values per dataset are highlighted in blue._\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\nThese results are aggregated across the 15 models for each dataset. While this provides insights into overall trends, in practice, one would typically seek to identify the best model-scenario combination for a given dataset under consideration.\n:::--DIVIDER--Key observations from these results include:\n\n1. **Variability**: There is substantial variability in which scenario performs best across different datasets, highlighting that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for handling class imbalance.\n\n2. **Scenario Performance**:\n\n   - Decision Threshold Calibration was best for 12 out of 30 datasets (40%)\n   - SMOTE was best for 9 datasets (30%)\n   - Class Weights was best for 7 datasets (23.3%)\n   - Baseline was best for 3 datasets (10%)\n   - There was one tie between SMOTE and Class Weights\n\n3. **Improvement Magnitude**: The degree of improvement over the Baseline varies greatly across datasets, from no improvement to substantial gains (e.g., satellite vs abalone_binarized).\n\n4. **Benefit of Imbalance Handling**: While no single technique consistently outperformed others across all datasets, the three imbalance handling strategies generally showed improvement over the Baseline for most datasets.\n\nThese results underscore the importance of testing multiple imbalance handling techniques for each specific dataset and task, rather than relying on a single approach. The variability observed suggests that the effectiveness of each method may depend on the unique characteristics of each dataset.\n\n\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\nOne notable observation is the contrast between these dataset-level results and the earlier model-level results. While the model-level analysis suggested Decision Threshold Calibration as a generally robust approach, the dataset-level results show much more variability. This apparent discrepancy highlights the complexity of handling class imbalance and suggests that the effectiveness of different techniques may be more dependent on dataset characteristics than on model type. \n:::--DIVIDER--\n## Statistical Analysis\n\nTo rigorously compare the performance of the four scenarios, we conducted statistical tests on the F1-scores aggregated by dataset (averaging across the 15 models for each dataset).\n\n<h2> Repeated Measures ANOVA </h2>\n\nWe performed a repeated measures ANOVA to test for significant differences among the four scenarios. For this test, we have 30 datasets, each with four scenario F1-scores, resulting in 120 data points. The null hypothesis is that there are no significant differences among the mean F1-scores of the four scenarios. We use Repeated Measures ANOVA to account because we have multiple measurements (scenarios) for each dataset.\n\n- **Result**: The test yielded a p-value of 2.01e-07, which is well below our alpha level of 0.05.\n- **Interpretation**: This result indicates statistically significant differences among the mean F1-scores of the four scenarios.\n\n<h2> Post-hoc Pairwise Comparisons </h2>\n\nFollowing the significant ANOVA result, we conducted post-hoc pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons. With 6 comparisons, our adjusted alpha level is 0.05/6 = 0.0083.\n\nThe p-values for the pairwise comparisons are presented in Table 1.\n\n**Table 1: P-values for pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni-corrected)**\n\n| Scenario           | Class Weights | Decision Threshold | SMOTE    |\n| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | -------- |\n| Baseline           | 7.77e-05      | 2.26e-04           | 1.70e-03 |\n| Class Weights      | -             | 2.06e-03           | 1.29e-01 |\n| Decision Threshold | -             | -                  | 2.83e-02 |\n\nKey findings from the pairwise comparisons:\n\n1. The Baseline scenario is significantly different from all other scenarios (p < 0.0083 for all comparisons).\n2. Class Weights is significantly different from Baseline and Decision Threshold, but not from SMOTE.\n3. There is no significant difference between SMOTE and Decision Threshold, or between SMOTE and Class Weights at the adjusted alpha level.\n\nThese results suggest that while all three imbalance handling techniques (SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold) significantly improve upon the Baseline, the differences among these techniques are less pronounced. The Decision Threshold approach shows a significant improvement over Baseline and Class Weights, but not over SMOTE, indicating that both Decision Threshold and SMOTE may be equally effective strategies for handling class imbalance in many cases.\n--DIVIDER--\n# Discussion of Results\n\n<h2> Key Findings and Implications </h2>\n\nOur comprehensive study on handling class imbalance in binary classification tasks yielded several important insights:\n\n1. **Addressing Class Imbalance**: Our results strongly suggest that handling class imbalance is crucial for improving model performance. Across most datasets and models, at least one of the imbalance handling techniques outperformed the baseline scenario, often by a significant margin. <br/><br/>\n\n2. **Effectiveness of SMOTE**: SMOTE demonstrated considerable effectiveness in minority class detection, showing significant improvements over the baseline in many cases. It was the best-performing method for 30% of the datasets, indicating its value as a class imbalance handling technique. However, it's important to note that while SMOTE improved minority class detection, it also showed the worst performance in terms of probability calibration, as evidenced by its high Log-Loss and Brier Score. This suggests that while SMOTE can be effective for improving classification performance, it may lead to less reliable probability estimates. Therefore, its use should be carefully considered in applications where well-calibrated probabilities are crucial. <br/><br/>\n\n3. **Optimal Method**: Decision Threshold Calibration emerged as the most consistently effective technique, performing best for 40% of datasets and showing robust performance across different model types. It's also worth noting that among the three methods studied, Decision Threshold Calibration is the least computationally expensive. Given its robust performance and efficiency, it could be considered a strong default choice for practitioners dealing with imbalanced datasets. <br/><br/>\n\n4. **Variability Across Datasets**: Despite the overall strong performance of Decision Threshold Calibration, we observed substantial variability in the best-performing method across datasets. This underscores the importance of testing multiple approaches for each specific problem. <br/><br/>\n\n5. **Importance of Dataset-Level Analysis**: Unlike many comparative studies on class imbalance that report results at the model level aggregated across datasets, our study emphasizes the importance of dataset-level analysis. We found that the best method can vary significantly depending on the dataset characteristics. This observation highlights the necessity of analyzing and reporting findings at the dataset level to provide a more nuanced and practical understanding of imbalance handling techniques.\n--DIVIDER--\n<h2> Study Limitations and Future Work </h2>\n\nWhile our study provides valuable insights, it's important to acknowledge its limitations:\n\n1. **Fixed Hyperparameters**: We used previously determined model hyperparameters. Future work could explore the impact of optimizing these hyperparameters specifically for imbalanced datasets. For instance, adjusting the maximum depth in tree models might allow for better modeling of rare classes. <br/><br/>\n\n2. **Statistical Analysis**: Our analysis relied on repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc tests. A more sophisticated approach, such as a mixed-effects model accounting for both dataset and model variability simultaneously, could provide additional insights and is an area for future research. <br/><br/>\n\n3. **Dataset Characteristics**: While we observed variability in performance across datasets, we didn't deeply analyze how specific dataset characteristics (e.g., sample size, number of features, degree of imbalance) might influence the effectiveness of different methods. Future work could focus on identifying patterns in dataset characteristics that predict which imbalance handling technique is likely to perform best. <br/><br/>\n\n4. **Limited Scope of Techniques**: Our study focused on three common techniques for handling imbalance. Future research could expand this to include other methods or combinations of methods. <br/><br/>\n\n5. **Performance Metric Focus**: While we reported multiple metrics, our analysis primarily focused on F1-score. Different applications might prioritize other metrics, and the relative performance of these techniques could vary depending on the chosen metric.\n\nThese limitations provide opportunities for future research to further refine our understanding of handling class imbalance in binary classification tasks. Despite these limitations, our study offers valuable guidance for practitioners and researchers dealing with imbalanced datasets, emphasizing the importance of addressing class imbalance and providing insights into the relative strengths of different approaches.\n--DIVIDER--# Conclusion\n\nOur study provides a comprehensive evaluation of three widely used strategies\u2014SMOTE, Class Weights, and Decision Threshold Calibration\u2014for handling imbalanced datasets in binary classification tasks. Compared to a baseline scenario where no intervention was applied, all three methods demonstrated substantial improvements in key metrics related to minority class detection, particularly the F1-score, across a wide range of datasets and machine learning models.\n\nThe results show that addressing class imbalance is crucial for improving model performance. Decision Threshold Calibration emerged as the most consistent and effective technique, offering significant performance gains across various datasets and models. SMOTE also performed well, and Class Weights tuning proved to be a reasonable method for handling class imbalance, showing moderate improvements over the baseline.\n\nHowever, the variability in performance across datasets highlights that no single method is universally superior. Therefore, practitioners should consider testing multiple approaches and tuning them based on their specific dataset characteristics.\n\nWhile our study offers valuable insights, certain areas could be explored in future research. We fixed the hyperparameters across scenarios to ensure fair comparisons, holding all factors constant except for the treatment. Future research could investigate optimizing hyperparameters specifically for imbalanced datasets. Additionally, further work could explore how specific dataset characteristics influence the effectiveness of different techniques. Expanding the scope to include other imbalance handling methods or combinations of methods would also provide deeper insights. While our primary analysis focused on the F1-score, results for other metrics are available, allowing for further exploration and custom analyses based on different performance criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings emphasize the importance of addressing class imbalance and offer guidance on choosing appropriate techniques based on dataset and model characteristics. Decision Threshold Calibration, with its strong and consistent performance, can serve as a valuable starting point for practitioners dealing with imbalanced datasets, but flexibility and experimentation remain key to achieving the best results.--DIVIDER--# Additional Resources\n\nTo support the reproducibility of our study and provide further value to researchers and practitioners, we have made several resources publicly available:\n\n1. **Model Repositories**: Implementations of all 15 models used in this study are available in separate repositories.

However, licenses play a crucial role in how the resources we create and use can be shared, modified, and deployed.\n\nA **license** is a legal instrument\u2014usually a document\u2014that outlines how a piece of work can be used by others. When you create a machine learning project or any software, you automatically hold the copyright to that work. By applying a license, you can permit others to use, modify, or distribute your work under specified conditions, all without relinquishing your copyright.\n\nWhy should machine learning practitioners care about licenses? It's simple: they offer a degree of protection while encouraging collaboration and innovation. Without a license, your work defaults to 'all rights reserved', preventing others from using, modifying, or sharing it. This isn't ideal for the machine learning community, which thrives on open-source projects, collaboration, and shared knowledge.\n\nBy attaching a license to your machine learning project, you provide explicit permission for others to use your work under certain conditions. This facilitates the sharing, adaptation, and even commercial use of your projects. Furthermore, a clear license can protect you from legal complications and misuse of your work.\n\nUnderstanding different types of licenses and their implications is essential. Some licenses, like the MIT License, permit anyone to use your work as long as you are credited, while others, like the GNU General Public License, place certain restrictions on the use or sharing of your work. By the end of this article, you'll have a solid understanding of these licenses, enabling you to choose one that fits your needs and intentions for your ML projects.--DIVIDER--## Glossary of Terms\n\nBefore we delve into the different types of licenses, let's define some common terms used in discussions about software licenses:\n\n- **Source Code**: The human-readable version of a software program, typically written in a programming language.<br><br>\n- **Binary Code**: The machine-readable version of a software program, which computers execute directly.<br><br>\n- **Open-Source Software (OSS)**: Software available for use, modification, and distribution, typically under licenses that comply with the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd).<br><br>\n- **Proprietary Software**: Software owned and controlled by an individual or company, restricting its use, modification, and distribution.<br><br>\n- **Freeware**: Software available at no monetary cost, but its source code might not be available for modification or distribution.<br><br>\n- **Shareware**: Software distributed free initially but may require payment for full functionality after a trial period.<br><br>\n- **Public Domain**: Works free for use by anyone without copyright restrictions.<br><br>\n- **Permissive Licenses**: Licenses (e.g., BSD, Apache) imposing minimal restrictions on software use, modification, and distribution.<br><br>\n- **Copyleft Licenses**: Licenses allowing derivative works but requiring them to adopt the same license as the original.<br><br>\n- **Derivative Work**: A work based on one or more pre-existing works, such as modifications or enhancements to original software.<br><br>\n- **Distribution**: Delivering software to others, whether via direct download, physical media, or other methods.<br><br>\n- **End-User License Agreement (EULA)**: A contract between the software author and user, outlining usage terms and restrictions.<br><br>\n- **Dual Licensing**: Offering software under two different licenses, typically one open-source and one proprietary.<br><br>\n- **Software Repository**: A storage location for software packages, often used in open-source contexts.<br><br>\n- **Contributor**: An individual or entity providing code or improvements to a software project.<br><br>\n- **Patent Rights**: Exclusive rights granted to inventors for their inventions. Some licenses grant users patent rights associated with the software, protecting them from infringement claims.\n\nWith these important terms defined, let's explore the different types of licenses.\n--DIVIDER--## Understanding License Types\n\nWhen it comes to licensing your machine learning projects, there are a plethora of options available, each with its own set of rules and restrictions. While it's not feasible to cover all license types, we'll focus on some of the most commonly used licenses in the machine learning and broader software development communities.\n\n### MIT License\n\nThe [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) is a permissive open-source license that's simple and straightforward. It allows users to do whatever they want with your work (including commercial use and modification) as long as they provide attribution back to you and don't hold you liable.\n\n### Apache License 2.0\n\nThe [Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) is similar to the MIT License in its permissions but includes a built-in grant of patent rights from contributors to users, offering a degree of legal protection against patent claims.\n\n### GNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nThe [GPL](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) is a \"strong\" copyleft license. This means:\n\n- If a project incorporates or links to GPL-licensed software/code in a manner that creates a derived work, it must be distributed under the GPL when shared with others.\n- Modifications to GPL code, when distributed, must also be released under the GPL.\n\n\n:::info{title=\"Note\"}\n### Understanding \"Derived Work\"\n\nA \"derived work\" refers to a new work that is based upon one or more pre-existing works. In the context of software and the GPL, it generally means a project that incorporates or is based on GPL-licensed code in such a way that it inherits the GPL's obligations. However, the exact definition of what constitutes a derived work can be legally complex and has been the subject of debates and varying interpretations. If unsure about whether your project constitutes a derived work, it's advisable to seek legal counsel.\n:::\n\n### GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)\n\nThe [LGPL](https://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license) can be seen as a \"lighter\" version of the GPL, often chosen for software libraries. Its key features are:\n\n- It permits proprietary software to link to LGPL-licensed libraries without requiring the entire software to be open-sourced.\n- If modifications are made to an LGPL library, only the modifications (and not the whole proprietary software) need to be open-sourced under the LGPL.\n\nIn essence, while both GPL and LGPL aim to promote open software, the LGPL provides greater flexibility for integration with proprietary software.\n\n### BSD Licenses\n\nThe [BSD Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php) are a family of permissive free software licenses. Unlike the more restrictive GPL, they allow for:\n\n- Redistribution of the source code and binary forms, with or without modification.\n- Use in proprietary software without the need to disclose the proprietary code.\n\nThe main requirement is that the BSD copyright notice is retained in redistributed code, ensuring credit to the original authors.\n\nRemember, choosing the right license depends on what you want others to be able to do with your work. Each license carries different implications for users of your project, whether it be for commercial use, open-source contributions, or private modifications. The key is to understand your goals for your project and how a license can help protect your interests and enable others to benefit from your work.\n\nIn the next section, we'll consider what factors should be taken into account when choosing a license for your ML projects.\n\n## Considerations for Choosing a License\n\nChoosing the right license for your machine learning project is a critical decision that requires careful thought. The choice of license directly influences how your project can be used, modified, and shared by others. Here are some important considerations to keep in mind:\n\n**Goals for Your Project**\nWhat do you hope to achieve with your project? Do you want it to be freely available for any use, or are you looking to monetize it? Do you want to encourage others to build upon your work, or would you rather maintain control over the modifications? Your answers to these questions will greatly influence the type of license you choose.\n\n**Community Norms**\nThe norms of the community in which you're working can also influence your choice of license. Some communities favor certain licenses, and using a similar license can facilitate collaboration.\n\n**Compatibility with Other Licenses**\nIf your work includes code or projects that are under other licenses, you need to consider license compatibility. Not all licenses are compatible with one another. For instance, a piece of software that is licensed under GPL cannot be included in a project that is licensed under a more permissive license, like MIT or Apache.\n\n**Commercial Use**\nYou'll need to decide if you want to allow commercial use of your project. Some licenses, like the MIT and Apache licenses, allow unrestricted use, including commercial use, while others, like the copyleft GPL license, require any derived works to also be open-sourced, which may be undesirable for some commercial purposes.\n\n**Contributions and Modifications**\nIf you're releasing an open-source project and hope to receive contributions from others, you'll need to think about how the license will affect potential contributors. More restrictive licenses might deter some contributors, while more permissive licenses might encourage contributions.\n\nRemember, there's no one-size-fits-all license. The best license for your ML project depends on your particular goals, the nature of your project, and the wider context in which your project will be used. In the next section, we'll discuss how licenses apply to open-source machine learning projects.\n--DIVIDER--\n## Licenses and Open Source ML Projects\n\nThe concept of open-source is fundamental in the machine learning community. It enables a collaborative environment where researchers and practitioners can share their work and build upon others', accelerating innovation and learning. Licensing plays a pivotal role in this landscape, determining how these open-source projects can be used, shared, and modified.\n\nWhen releasing your machine learning projects as open-source, it's crucial to apply an appropriate license. Without a license, despite the source code being publicly available, others don't technically have the right to use, modify, or distribute the work. By adding a license, you explicitly grant these permissions.\n\nThe choice of license also impacts the kind of contributions you can receive. For instance, permissive licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0 are often used in open-source ML projects to encourage contributions, as they allow others to freely use, modify, and distribute the work, including in proprietary software.\n\nOn the other hand, copyleft licenses like GPL ensure that derivatives of your work also remain open-source, fostering an environment of open collaboration but potentially limiting the use of your work in proprietary software.\n\nFurthermore, consider that your open-source ML project may be used in combination with other projects or software. The compatibility of licenses becomes crucial in this context, as conflicts could legally prevent usage of your project.\n\nIn summary, the licensing of your open-source machine learning project has a profound impact on its use, distribution, and potential for collaboration. As such, understanding the implications of different licenses is crucial when contributing to the open-source machine learning community.\n\nIn the next section, we will explore the concept of dual licensing and its implications for machine learning projects.\n--DIVIDER--\n## Dual Licensing\n\nDual licensing is a strategy wherein the owner of a software offers the software under two different licenses. One of these licenses is typically an open-source license that might have certain restrictions, and the other is typically a commercial or proprietary license that allows uses not permitted by the open-source license.\n\nWhy would someone choose to dual license their machine learning project? The reasons can vary, but one common rationale is to allow the project to be freely used and modified in open-source projects, while also offering a paid license for commercial use that provides additional benefits, like the ability to keep modifications private or to get support services.\n\nHere's an example of how dual licensing might work:\n\n1. You develop a machine learning project and you want to contribute to the open-source community, so you release the project under the GPL, which requires any modifications to also be open-source.\n2. However, a company wants to use your project in a proprietary software product and they do not want to open-source their modifications. To accommodate this use case, you offer a commercial license that allows for private modifications in exchange for a fee.\n\nRemember, dual licensing can add complexity to your licensing strategy and may require you to manage different obligations for different users. Additionally, dual licensing only makes sense if you hold all the rights to the software or project; if your work is based on someone else's GPL-licensed work, for instance, you won't be able to offer a proprietary license.\n\nIn the following section, we'll guide you through the practical process of applying a license to your machine learning project.--DIVIDER--## How to Apply a License to Your ML Project\n\nApplying a license to your machine learning project doesn't have to be a complex process. In essence, it involves including a license file in your project and, if necessary, adding license headers to your source files. Here are the general steps:\n\n**Choose a License**\nFirst, based on the considerations we've discussed, choose a license that aligns with your goals for your project. The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) provides a comprehensive list of open source licenses you can choose from. Websites like [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) or [TL;DR Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/) can be handy resources to understand licenses in simple terms.\n\n**Add a LICENSE File**\nOnce you've chosen a license, create a file in the root of your project repository named `LICENSE` (or `LICENSE.txt`). Into this file, you should put the full text of the chosen license. The text can usually be obtained from the license's official website or a trusted source like the Open Source Initiative. For licenses like the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses, there's usually a line in the license text where you would insert your name (or your organization's name) as the copyright holder and the year. Be sure to replace these placeholders with the appropriate information.\n\n**Add License Headers (Optional)**\nFor some licenses, particularly those that require sharing changes under the same license (like the GPL), it's recommended to add a short license header to the top of each source file in your project. This header usually includes the name of the license, the year, and the copyright holder's name. Here's an example for the GPL:\n\n```python\n# Copyright (C) [year]  [name of author or organization]\n#\n# This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n# it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n# the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n# (at your option) any later version.\n```\n\n**Announce Your License**\nLastly, it's good practice to mention the license in your `README.md` file and in any public-facing documentation, so that it's clear to all users what license your project is under.\n\nRemember that while this process is relatively straightforward, it's important to choose your license carefully and to apply it correctly to ensure that your intentions for your project are clear. If you have any doubts or concerns, consider consulting with a legal expert.\n\nIn the next section, we'll share some best practices for licensing machine learning projects.\n--DIVIDER--## Best Practices in Licensing ML Pprojects\n\nAs we've seen, licensing is an important aspect of managing and sharing machine learning projects. As we close this article, here are some best practices to consider:\n\n1. **Ensure Clarity**: Be sure to clearly communicate the licensing of your machine learning project. Include a `LICENSE` file in the root directory of your project, and mention the license in your `README.md` file.<br><br>\n2. **Honor Existing Licenses**: If your project uses or builds upon others' work, ensure that you respect the terms of those licenses. Consult with a legal expert if you're unsure.<br><br>\n3. **Align with Community Norms**: Consider the norms of your community when choosing a license. Aligning with commonly used licenses in your community can facilitate collaboration and compatibility with other projects.<br><br>\n4. **Mind Compatibility**: If your project is intended to be used with other projects or software, consider how your chosen license interacts with the licenses of those projects. Legal conflicts arising from license incompatibilities can be problematic.<br><br>\n5. **Review Your License Choice**: As your project evolves, your original licensing choice might no longer serve your goals. It's good practice to revisit your licensing strategy as your project grows and changes.<br><br>\n6. **Consider Dual Licensing**: If you're looking to both contribute to the open-source community and monetize your project, consider dual licensing. This allows you to offer your project under both an open-source and a commercial license.<br><br>\n7. **Seek Legal Advice When Needed**: Licensing involves legal decisions. If you're ever unsure about your licensing choices or obligations, it's best to consult with a legal expert.\n\nThese practices can help you ensure that your intentions for your machine learning project are clear, you're respectful of others' work, and your project can be used, modified, and shared in the ways you intend.--DIVIDER--## Summary\n\nIn this article, we've explored the role of licenses for machine learning projects, covering key terms, license types, and considerations for choosing a license. We discussed open-source and dual licensing strategies and provided a guide on how to apply a license to your ML project. Key best practices were highlighted, including clarity in licensing, respect for other licenses, and the need for license compatibility. As a final reminder, always consult with a legal expert if you're unsure about any licensing matters.\n\n-----DIVIDER--## References\n\n1.

To aid in your understanding and to provide a quick resource for your projects, we've compiled the full templates for some of the most widely-used licenses in the machine learning and open-source community.\n\nFeel free to explore each template and select one that aligns with your project's goals:\n\n- [MIT License Template](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)\n- [Apache 2.0 License Template](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)\n- [GNU General Public License (GPL) Template](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html#license-text)\n- [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) Template](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html#license-text)\n- [BSD 2-Clause License Template](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)--DIVIDER--### FAQ\n\n**Q: Does open-source mean free?**  \nA: Open-source refers to the accessibility of the source code, not the cost of the software. Open-source software is generally free to use and modify, and can often be distributed under the terms of the specific license. However, the exact permissions and restrictions can vary depending on the license. Some open-source licenses allow the software to be incorporated into commercial products which can be sold.\n\n**Q: If you don't include a license in your project, what happens?**  \nA: Without a license, the default copyright laws typically apply, which means you retain all rights and others are not legally permitted to use, modify, or distribute your project. However, laws can vary by country, so it's always best to specify a license to make your intentions clear.\n\n**Q: What if I want to use a project that doesn't specify a license?**  \nA: It's generally recommended not to use, modify, or distribute a project that doesn't specify a license, as this implies that the creator retains all rights and hasn't granted any explicit permission to others to use their work. It's always best to reach out to the creator and ask for clarification.\n\n**Q: Can you change the license of a project after it has been released?**  \nA: Yes, but it can be complicated. If you are the sole contributor to the project, you can change the license at any time. However, if your project has contributions from others, you will need their permissions to change the license. Also, users who received the project under the original license can continue to use that version under its original terms.\n\n**Q: Can you take someone's project and release it under a different license?**  \nA: Generally no, unless the original license allows it or you have explicit permission from the copyright holder. Always check the terms of the original license.\n\n**Q: Can you take someone's project, modify it, and release it under the same license?**  \nA: Most open-source licenses allow this, but you should always check the specific terms of the license.\n\n**Q: Can you take someone's project, modify it, and release it under a different license?**  \nA: It depends on the terms of the original license. While you can generally modify someone's project, releasing that modification under a different license is often restricted. Some licenses may allow it, while others may not. If a new license is applied to a derivative work, it's often required or at least good practice to acknowledge the original work and its license. Always check the terms of the original license.\n\n**Q: Can you use someone's project in a commercial application?**  \nA: It depends on the license of the project. Some licenses, like the Apache 2.0 or MIT licenses, allow for commercial use. Others, like the AGPL, have conditions that can complicate commercial use. Always check the license terms.\n\n**Q: How does licensing work when combining code with different licenses?**  \nA: When combining code with different licenses, it's important to consider license compatibility. Some licenses, like MIT and BSD, are permissive and have few restrictions, which makes them broadly compatible with other licenses. Others, like GPL, have stronger restrictions and require that any derivative work also be licensed under GPL. Always review the terms of each license to ensure they are compatible.\n\n**Q: Can I use commonly used libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch in my project and release it under a license of my choice?**  \nA: Yes, but your chosen license must be compatible with the licenses of the libraries. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch use the Apache 2.0 License, and scikit-learn uses a modified BSD license, which are all permissive licenses, meaning they have few restrictions on how you can use the libraries.\n\n**Q: Can I use commonly used libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch in my commercial application?**  \nA: Yes, these libraries use permissive licenses (Apache 2.0 for TensorFlow and PyTorch, a modified BSD for scikit-learn) that allow for commercial use.\n\n**Q: Can I use commonly used R packages in my project and release it under a license of my choice?**  \nA: Yes, but your chosen license must be compatible with the licenses of the packages. Many R packages are licensed under the GPL, which requires that derivative works (which could include projects that heavily use the package) are also licensed under the GPL.\n\n**Q: Can I use commonly used R packages in my commercial application?**  \nA: It depends on the license of the packages. Many R packages are licensed under the GPL, which allows commercial use but has certain requirements if you distribute your application to others. Always check the license terms.",

This publication demonstrates these capabilities using the MNIST dataset, providing practical insights for AI/ML practitioners.\n\n-----DIVIDER--# Introduction\n\nVariational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models that exemplify unsupervised deep learning. They use a probabilistic approach to encode data into a distribution of latent variables, enabling both data compression and the generation of new, similar data instances.\n\nVAEs have become crucial in modern machine learning due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate new samples without requiring explicit labels. This versatility makes them valuable for tasks like image generation, enhancement, anomaly detection, and noise reduction across various domains including healthcare, autonomous driving, and multimedia generation.\n\nThis publication demonstrates five key applications of VAEs: data compression, data generation, noise reduction, anomaly detection, and missing data imputation. By exploring these diverse use cases, we aim to showcase VAEs' versatility in solving various machine learning problems, offering practical insights for AI/ML practitioners.\n\nTo illustrate these capabilities, we use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. This well-known dataset, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images, provides a manageable yet challenging benchmark for exploring VAEs' performance in different data processing tasks. Through our examples with MNIST, we demonstrate how VAEs can effectively handle a range of challenges, from basic image compression to more complex tasks like anomaly detection and data imputation.\n\nCheck the **Models** section for the github code repository for this publication.--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Note\"}\nAlthough the original MNIST images are in black and white, we have utilized color palettes in our visualizations to make the demonstrations more visually engaging.\n:::--DIVIDER--# Understanding VAEs\n<h2> Basic Concept and Architecture</h2>\nVAEs are a class of generative models designed to encode data into a compressed latent space and then decode it to reconstruct the original input. The architecture of a VAE consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. --DIVIDER--\n![VAE_architecture.png](VAE_architecture.png)--DIVIDER--The diagram above illustrates the key components of a VAE:\n1. <b>Encoder:</b> Compresses the input data into a latent space representation.\n2. <b>Latent Space (Z):</b> Represents the compressed data as a probability distribution, typically Gaussian.\n3. <b>Decoder:</b> Reconstructs the original input from a sample drawn from the latent space distribution.\n--DIVIDER--The encoder takes an input, such as an image, call it $X$, and compresses it into a set of parameters defining a probability distribution in the latent space\u2014typically the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution. This probabilistic approach is what sets VAEs apart; instead of encoding an input as a single point, it is represented as a distribution over potential values. The decoder then uses a sample from this distribution to reconstruct the original input (shows as $$\\hat{X}$$). This sampling process would normally make the process non-differentiable. To overcome this challenge, VAEs use the so-called \"reparameterization trick,\" which allows the model to back-propagate gradients through random operations by decomposing the sampling process into deterministic and stochastic components. This makes the VAE end-to-end differentiable which enables training using backpropagation.--DIVIDER--<h2> Comparison with Traditional Auto-Encoders </h2>\n\nWhile VAEs share some similarities with traditional auto-encoders, they have distinct features that set them apart.

This implementation is designed to work with the MNIST dataset, encoding 28x28 pixel images into a latent space and then reconstructing them.\n\nThe full code is available here: [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/readytensor/rt_img_compression_autoencoder/blob/main/src/vae.ipynb)\n\nThe following code defines a VAE class that includes both the encoder and decoder networks. It also implements the reparameterization trick, which is crucial for allowing backpropagation through the sampling process. Additionally, we'll look at the loss function, which combines reconstruction loss with the Kullback-Leibler divergence to ensure the latent space has good properties for generation.--DIVIDER--\n```python\nclass VAE(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, latent_dim):\n        super(VAE, self).__init__()\n        \n        # Encoder\n        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1)  # Input is 1x28x28, output is 32x14x14\n        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1) # Output is 64x7x7\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 400)\n        self.fc21 = nn.Linear(400, latent_dim)  # mu\n        self.fc22 = nn.Linear(400, latent_dim)  # logvar\n        \n        # Decoder\n        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(latent_dim, 400)\n        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(400, 64 * 7 * 7)\n        self.conv2_t = nn.ConvTranspose2d(64, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1) # Output is 32x14x14\n        self.conv1_t = nn.ConvTranspose2d(32, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1)  # Output is 1x28x28\n\n    def encode(self, x):\n        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))\n        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))\n        x = x.view(-1, 64 * 7 * 7)\n        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n        return self.fc21(x), self.fc22(x)\n\n    def reparameterize(self, mu, logvar):\n        std = torch.exp(0.5 * logvar)\n        eps = torch.randn_like(std)\n        return mu + eps * std\n    \n    def decode(self, z):\n        z = F.relu(self.fc3(z))\n        z = F.relu(self.fc4(z))\n        z = z.view(-1, 64, 7, 7)\n        z = F.relu(self.conv2_t(z))\n        z = torch.sigmoid(self.conv1_t(z))\n        return z\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        mu, logvar = self.encode(x)\n        z = self.reparameterize(mu, logvar)\n        return self.decode(z), mu, logvar\n\n\n# Loss function\ndef loss_function(recon_x, x, mu, logvar):\n    # Calculate the Binary Cross Entropy loss between the reconstructed image and the original image\n    BCE = F.binary_cross_entropy(recon_x, x, reduction='sum')\n\n    # KL divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution.\n    # For VAEs, it measures how much information is lost when using the approximations of the distributions.\n    KLD = -0.5 * torch.sum(1 + logvar - mu.pow(2) - logvar.exp())\n\n    return BCE + KLD\n```\n--DIVIDER--Let's dissect each part of the code to understand how a VAE is built and operates using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library.\n\nFirst, we have the constructor:\n```python\ndef __init__(self, latent_dim):\n    super(VAE, self).__init__()\n\n    # Encoder\n    self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1)  # Input is 1x28x28, output is 32x14x14\n    self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1) # Output is 64x7x7\n    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 400)\n    self.fc21 = nn.Linear(400, latent_dim)  # mu\n    self.fc22 = nn.Linear(400, latent_dim)  # logvar\n\n    # Decoder\n    self.fc3 = nn.Linear(latent_dim, 400)\n    self.fc4 = nn.Linear(400, 64 * 7 * 7)\n    self.conv2_t = nn.ConvTranspose2d(64, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1) # Output is 32x14x14\n    self.conv1_t = nn.ConvTranspose2d(32, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1)\n```\nThe `__init__` method initializes the VAE. It takes latent_dim as an argument, specifying the size of the latent space, a key feature of the VAE that determines the dimensionality of the encoded representation. It contains the definition of the encoder and decoder parts.\n\n<h2> Encoder Network</h2>\n\n```python\nself.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1)\nself.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1)\nself.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 7 * 7, 400)\nself.fc21 = nn.Linear(400, latent_dim)  # Mean (mu)\nself.fc22 = nn.Linear(400, latent_dim)  # Log variance (logvar)\n```\n\nThe Encoder consists of convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The convolutional layers help in capturing spatial hierarchies in the image data, reducing its dimensionality before it is mapped to the latent space parameters by the fully connected layers.\n\n<h2> Decoder Network </h2>\n\n```python\nself.fc3 = nn.Linear(latent_dim, 400)\nself.fc4 = nn.Linear(400, 64 * 7 * 7)\nself.conv2_t = nn.ConvTranspose2d(64, 32, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1)\nself.conv1_t = nn.ConvTranspose2d(32, 1, kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=1, output_padding=1)\n```\nThe Decoder utilizes transposed convolutional layers to perform the inverse operation of the encoder, upscaling the encoded latent representations back to the original image dimensions.\n\n<h2> Loss function</h2>\n\n```python\ndef loss_function(recon_x, x, mu, logvar):\n    BCE = F.binary_cross_entropy(recon_x, x, reduction='sum')\n    KLD = -0.5 * torch.sum(1 + logvar - mu.pow(2) - logvar.exp())\n    return BCE + KLD\n```\n\nThe loss function combines binary cross-entropy (BCE) for reconstruction loss and the KL divergence (KLD) for regularizing the latent space distribution.\n\n<h2> Additional Methods</h2>\n\n```python\ndef encode(self, x):\n    x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))\n    x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))\n    x = x.view(-1, 64 * 7 * 7)\n    x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n    return self.fc21(x), self.fc22(x)\n\ndef reparameterize(self, mu, logvar):\n    std = torch.exp(0.5 * logvar)\n    eps = torch.randn_like(std)\n    return mu + eps * std\n\ndef decode(self, z):\n    z = F.relu(self.fc3(z))\n    z = F.relu(self.fc4(z))\n    z = z.view(-1, 64, 7, 7)\n    z = F.relu(self.conv2_t(z))\n    z = torch.sigmoid(self.conv1_t(z))\n    return z\n\ndef forward(self, x):\n    mu, logvar = self.encode(x)\n    z = self.reparameterize(mu, logvar)\n    return self.decode(z), mu, logvar\n```\n\n- Encode Function: Transforms the input image into two sets of parameters in the latent space, representing the means and log variances.<br>\n- Reparameterize Function: Uses the reparameterization trick to allow for gradient backpropagation through stochastic processes.<br>\n- Decode Function: Reconstructs the image from the latent space representation.\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n<h2>Note on Model Architecture</h2>\nIt's important to note that the architecture of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) is highly adaptable and does not need to be confined to any specific type of layer or structure. VAEs can be designed using a variety of architectural components to suit specific tasks and data types. While convolutional layers are ideal for image data, fully connected (linear) layers may be better suited for tabular data. For sequential or time series data, incorporating LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers can be highly effective. This flexibility allows VAEs to be tailored to a wide range of applications, optimizing performance across different types of data.\n:::--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n<h2>What is Reparameterization?</h2>\nIn the context of a VAE, the encoder network generates two parameters: mean (mu) and log-variance (logvar) of a Gaussian distribution. Instead of directly sampling from this distribution (which would inhibit gradient flow because sampling is a stochastic process), the reparameterization trick is used to decompose the sampling process into a deterministic part and a stochastic part. <br><br>\n\n<h3>Breakdown of the reparameterize Function</h3>\n\n```python\ndef reparameterize(self, mu, logvar):\n    std = torch.exp(0.5 * logvar)  # Convert log-variance to standard deviation\n    eps = torch.randn_like(std)   # Generate random noise with a standard normal distribution\n    return mu + eps * std         # Scale and shift the noise to create the sample\n```\n\n1. Convert Log-Variance to Standard Deviation:\n\n- `std = torch.exp(0.5 * logvar)`\nThe log variance (`logvar`) is transformed into the standard deviation (`std`). This transformation is necessary because the variance must be non-negative and the logarithm of variance can range from negative infinity to positive infinity, making it easier to optimize. The 0.5 factor is due to the properties of logarithms (since variance = exp(logvar) and std = sqrt(variance)).\n\n2. Generate Random Noise:\n\n- `eps = torch.randn_like(std)`\nRandom noise `eps` is generated from a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, std = 1) with the same shape as the standard deviation. This randomness introduces the stochastic element needed for the generative process.\n3. Scale and Shift the Noise:\n\n- `return mu + eps * std`\nThe noise is scaled by the standard deviation and shifted by the mean (`mu`). This step effectively samples from the Gaussian distribution defined by `mu` and `std`, but in a way that allows the gradients to flow back through the parameters `mu` and `logvar` during training.\n:::\n--DIVIDER--# Applying VAEs: From Theory to Practice\n\nNow that we've explored the theoretical underpinnings of VAEs and examined a concrete implementation in PyTorch, let's dive into the practical applications of this powerful model. We'll start by focusing on one of the most fundamental capabilities of VAEs: data compression.\n\nIn the following sections, we'll demonstrate how VAEs can be utilized for efficient data compression, using the MNIST dataset as our example. This application showcases the VAE's ability to capture the essence of complex data in a compact latent representation, a feature that has significant implications for data storage, transmission, and processing.\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Note on Applicability\"}\nWhile our examples use MNIST for simplicity, the principles of VAE applications extend to various real-world datasets. These techniques can be adapted for diverse scenarios, from image processing to tabular data to time series analysis, offering powerful solutions for data compression, generation, denoising, anomaly detection, and imputation across different domains.\n:::--DIVIDER--## Data Compression and Dimensionality Reduction\n\nModern data-driven applications often require efficient methods for data compression and dimensionality reduction to manage storage, processing, and transmission costs. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) offer a powerful solution to this challenge, particularly for complex, high-dimensional data like images.\n\n<h2> How VAEs Compress MNIST Images </h2>\nVariational Auto-Encoders offer a novel approach to data compression through their probabilistic latent space. When applying VAEs to the MNIST dataset, the process involves:<br><br>\n\n1. Encoding: Each 28x28 pixel image of the MNIST dataset, representing handwritten digits, is input into the encoder part of the VAE. The encoder network compresses this image into a much smaller set of latent variables, capturing the essential features of the image in terms of mean and variance.\n   Latent Space Representation: The critical information of each image is stored in a lower-dimensional latent space, where the size of this space is significantly smaller than the original image size, effectively compressing the image data.<br><br>\n2. Decoding: The decoder part of the VAE then takes these latent variables and reconstructs the image, aiming to match the original as closely as possible. The training process involves tuning the encoder and decoder to minimize the loss, ensuring that the essential features are preserved.\n\n<h2> Visualizing Compressed vs. Original Digits </h2>\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of VAEs in compressing MNIST images, we can visualize the original and the reconstructed images side by side:\n\n![vae_reconstruction.jpg](vae_reconstruction.jpg)\n\nThe results show how VAEs can effectively compress the 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits into a lower-dimensional latent space of size 10 that is 1.2% of the original size. Despite this significant reduction in dimensionality, the reconstructed images closely resemble the originals, demonstrating the VAE's powerful ability to capture essential features while compressing the data.--DIVIDER--## Data Generation\n<h2>The Need for Synthetic Data in AI/ML </h2>\nSynthetic data generation plays a crucial role in AI/ML, especially when real data is scarce, sensitive, or expensive to collect. It's valuable for augmenting training datasets, improving model robustness, and providing controlled scenarios for testing and validation. <br/><br/>\n\n<h2> Generating New MNIST-like Digits with VAEs</h2>\nVAEs stand out in their ability to generate new data that mimics the original training data. Here\u2019s how VAEs can be used to generate new, MNIST-like digits:<br><br>\n\n1. **Training**: A VAE is first trained on the MNIST dataset, learning the underlying distribution of the data represented in a latent space. <br/>\n2. **Sampling**: After training, new points are sampled from the latent space distribution. Because this space has been regularized during training (encouraged to approximate a Gaussian distribution), the samples are likely to be meaningful.<br/>\n3. **Decoding**: These sampled latent points are then passed through the decoder, which reconstructs new digits that reflect the characteristics of the training data but are novel creations. <br/>\n\n<h2> Exploring the Latent Space: Morphing Between Digits</h2>\nOne of the fascinating capabilities of VAEs is exploring and visualizing the continuity and interpolation capabilities within the latent space:<br><br>\n\n1. Continuous Interpolation: By choosing two points in the latent space corresponding to different digits, one can interpolate between these points. The decoder generates outputs that gradually transition from one digit to another, illustrating how features morph seamlessly from one to the other.<br><br>\n2. Visualizing Morphing: This can be visualized by creating a sequence of images where each image represents a step from one latent point to another. This not only demonstrates the smoothness of the latent space but also the VAE\u2019s ability to handle and mix digit features creatively.<br><br>\n3. Insight into Latent Variables: Such explorations provide insights into what features are captured by different dimensions of the latent space (e.g., digit thickness, style, orientation).\n\nWe trained a VAE on MNIST with a 2D latent space for easy visualization and manipulation. This allows us to observe how changes in latent variables affect generated images. The figure below shows generated images for latent dimension values from -3 to 3 on both axes: \n\n![vae_grid_plot.jpg](vae_grid_plot.jpg)\n\nThis exploration is not only a powerful demonstration of the model's internal representations but also serves as a tool for understanding and debugging the model\u2019s behavior.\n--DIVIDER--## Noise Reduction\nNoise in data is a common issue in various fields, from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles. It can significantly degrade the performance of machine learning models, making effective denoising techniques crucial.\n\n<h2> Demonstrating VAE-based Denoising on MNIST</h2>\nWe trained multiple VAEs to remove noise from MNIST images, testing different noise percentages. We created noisy images by randomly replacing a sample of pixels with values from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1.\n\nThe following images show the denoising performance of VAEs at different levels of noise contamination:\n\n![noisy_vs_denoised_0.05.jpg](noisy_vs_denoised_0.05.jpg)\n![noisy_vs_denoised_0.1.jpg](noisy_vs_denoised_0.1.jpg)\n![noisy_vs_denoised_0.25.jpg](noisy_vs_denoised_0.25.jpg)\n![noisy_vs_denoised_0.5.jpg](noisy_vs_denoised_0.5.jpg)\n\nResults seen in the charts above demonstrate the VAE's capability in reconstructing clean images from noisy inputs, highlighting its potential in restoring and enhancing image data usability in practical scenarios.\n--DIVIDER--## Anomaly Detection\nAnomaly detection is crucial in various industries, identifying patterns that deviate from expected behavior. These anomalies can indicate critical issues such as fraudulent transactions or mechanical faults.\n\n<h2> Using VAEs to Spot Anomalies in MNIST</h2>\nVAEs can effectively detect anomalies by modeling the distribution of normal data:\n\n1. The VAE is trained on MNIST digits.\n2. Anomalies are identified by higher reconstruction loss on test set.\n3. A threshold is set to flag digits with excessive loss as anomalies.\n\nThe histogram below shows reconstruction errors on the test set:\n\n![reconstruction_errors_histogram.jpg](reconstruction_errors_histogram.jpg)\n\nThe following images show the top 10 digits with the highest loss, representing potential anomalies:\n\n![highest_reconstruction_errors.jpg](highest_reconstruction_errors.jpg)\n\nWe can confirm that the 10 samples are badly written digits and should be considered anomalies. \n\n\n\nTo further test the VAE's anomaly detection capabilities, we tested the VAE model on images of letters\u2014data that the model was not trained on. This experiment serves two purposes:\n\n1. Validating the model's ability to identify clear out-of-distribution samples.\n2. Exploring the nuances of how the model interprets shapes similar to digits.\n\nThe following chart shows the original images of letters and their reconstructions.\n\n![letter_reconstruction.jpg](letter_reconstruction.jpg)\n\nWe also marked the reconstruction errors of the samples on the histogram of reconstruction errors from the test set. \n\n![reconstruction_errors_with_letters.jpg](reconstruction_errors_with_letters.jpg)\n\nThese visualizations reveal several interesting insights:\n\n1. Most letters, except 'Z', show poor reconstructions and high reconstruction errors, clearly marking them as anomalies.\n\n2. The letter 'Z' is reconstructed relatively well, likely due to its similarity to the digit '2'. Its reconstruction error falls within the normal range of the test set.\n\n3. The letter 'M' shows the most distorted reconstruction, corresponding to the highest reconstruction error. This aligns with 'M' being the most dissimilar to any MNIST digit.\n\n4. Interestingly, 'H' is reconstructed to somewhat resemble the digit '8', the closest MNIST digit in shape. While still an anomaly, it has the lowest error among the non-'Z' letters.\n\nThis experiment highlights:\n- The VAE's effectiveness in identifying clear anomalies (most letters).\n- The model's tendency to interpret unfamiliar shapes in terms of the digits it knows.\n- The importance of shape similarities in the model's interpretation, as demonstrated by the 'Z' and 'H' cases.\n\nThese observations underscore the VAE's capability in anomaly detection while also revealing its limitations when faced with out-of-distribution data that shares similarities with in-distribution samples.--DIVIDER--## Missing Data Imputation\nIncomplete data is a common challenge in machine learning, leading to biased estimates and less reliable models. This issue is prevalent in various domains, including healthcare and finance.\n\n<h2> Reconstructing Partial MNIST Digits with VAEs </h2>\n\n\nVAEs offer a robust approach to missing data imputation:\n\n1. Training: A VAE learns the distribution of complete MNIST digits.\n\n2. Simulating Missing Data: During training, parts of input digits are randomly masked. The VAE is tasked with reconstructing the full, original digit from this partial input.\n\n3. Inference: When presented with new partial digits, the VAE leverages its learned distributions to infer and reconstruct missing sections, effectively filling in the gaps.\n\nThis process enables the VAE to generalize from partial information, making it adept at handling various missing data scenarios.\n\nThe image below demonstrates the VAE's capability in missing data imputation:\n\n\n![missing_vs_reconstructed.jpg](missing_vs_reconstructed.jpg)\n\nThese examples illustrate how effectively the VAE infers and reconstructs missing parts of the digits, showcasing its potential for data imputation tasks.\n--DIVIDER--# VAEs vs. GANs\n\nWhile this publication has focused on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it's important to consider how they compare to other popular generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Both VAEs and GANs are powerful techniques for data generation in machine learning, but they approach the task in fundamentally different ways and have distinct strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGANs, introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014, have gained significant attention for their ability to generate highly realistic images. They work by setting up a competition between two neural networks: a generator that creates fake data, and a discriminator that tries to distinguish fake data from real data. This adversarial process often results in very high-quality outputs, particularly in image generation tasks.\n\nUnderstanding the differences between VAEs and GANs can help practitioners choose the most appropriate model for their specific use case. The following table provides a detailed comparison of these two approaches:\n\nThe following table provides a detailed comparison of these two approaches:\n\n| Aspect | Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) | Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) |\n|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Output Quality | Slightly blurrier, but consistent | Sharper, more realistic images |\n| Training Process | Easier and usually faster to train, well-defined objective function | Can be challenging and time-consuming, potential mode collapse |\n| Latent Space | Structured and interpretable | Less structured, harder to control |\n| Versatility | Excel in both generation and inference tasks | Primarily focused on generation tasks |\n| Stability | More stable training, consistent results | Can suffer from training instability |\n| Primary Use Cases | Data compression, denoising, anomaly detection, controlled generation | High-fidelity image generation, data augmentation |\n| Reconstruction Ability | Built-in reconstruction capabilities | No inherent reconstruction ability |\n| Inference | Capable of inference on new data | Typically requires additional techniques for inference |\n\n<h2> When to Choose VAEs over GANs </h2>\n\n- Applications requiring both generation and reconstruction capabilities\n- Tasks needing interpretable and controllable latent representations\n- Scenarios demanding training stability and result consistency\n- Projects involving data compression, denoising, or anomaly detection\n- When balancing generation quality with ease of implementation and versatility\n- When faster training times are preferred--DIVIDER--# Conclusion\n\nThis article has demonstrated the versatility of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) across various machine learning applications, including data compression, generation, noise reduction, anomaly detection, and missing data imputation. VAEs' unique ability to model complex distributions and generate new data instances makes them powerful tools for tasks where traditional methods may fall short.\n\nWe encourage researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore VAEs further. Whether refining architectures, applying them to new data types, or integrating them with other techniques, the potential for innovation is vast. We hope this exploration inspires you to incorporate VAEs into your work, contributing to technological advancement and opening new avenues for discovery.\n\n-----DIVIDER--# References\n\n1.

Assessing Technical Content\n\nThe technical quality of an AI/ML publication depends heavily on its type. A research paper requires comprehensive methodology and experimental validation, while a tutorial focuses on clear step-by-step instructions and practical implementation. Understanding these differences is crucial for creating high-quality content that meets readers' expectations.\n\n**Understanding Assessment Criteria**\n\nRefer to the comprehensive bank of assessment criteria specifically for AI/ML publications (detailed in **Appendix A**). These criteria cover various aspects including:\n\n- Purpose and objectives definition\n- Technical depth and methodology\n- Data handling and documentation\n- Implementation details\n- Results and validation\n- Practical considerations\n- Educational effectiveness\n- Industry relevance\n- Technical asset documentation\n\n**Matching Criteria to Publication Types**\n\nDifferent publication types require different combinations of these criteria. For example:\n\n- **Research Papers** emphasize originality, methodology, and experimental validation\n- **Tutorials** focus on prerequisites, step-by-step guidance, and code explanations\n- **Case Studies** prioritize problem definition, solution impact, and business outcomes\n- **Technical Deep Dives** concentrate on theoretical foundations and technical accuracy\n\nA complete mapping of criteria to publication types is provided in **Appendix B**, serving as a checklist for authors. When writing your publication, refer to the criteria specific to your chosen type to ensure you're meeting all necessary requirements.\n\n**Using the Assessment Framework**\n\nTo create high-quality technical content:\n\n1. **Identify Your Publication Type**\n   - Review the publication types described earlier\n   - Select the type that best matches your content's purpose\n\n2. **Review Relevant Criteria**\n   - Consult Appendix B for criteria specific to your publication type\n   - Use these criteria as a planning checklist before writing\n\n3. **Assess Your Content**\n   - Regularly check your work against the relevant criteria\n   - Ensure you're meeting the requirements, especially those that would be considered essential to the publication type\n\n4. **Iterate and Improve**\n   - Review areas where criteria aren't fully met\n   - Strengthen sections that need more depth or clarity\n   - Refine content until all relevant criteria are satisfied\n   - Polish your work through multiple revisions\n\nRemember, these criteria serve as guidelines rather than rigid rules. The goal is to ensure your publication effectively serves its intended purpose and audience. For detailed criteria descriptions and publication-specific requirements, refer to Appendices A and B.\n\n**Quality vs. Quantity**\n\nMeeting the assessment criteria isn't about increasing length or adding unnecessary complexity. Instead, focus on:\n\n- Addressing each relevant criterion thoroughly but concisely\n- Including only content that serves your publication's purpose\n- Maintaining appropriate technical depth for your audience\n- Providing clear value to readers\n\nWith these technical content fundamentals in place, we can move on to enhancing readability and appeal, which we'll cover in the next section.\n--DIVIDER--\n# 5. Enhancing readability and appeal\n\nCreating an engaging publication requires more than just presenting your findings. To capture and maintain your audience's attention, it's essential to structure your content in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format. The following guidelines will help you enhance the readability and overall impact of your publication, making it accessible and compelling to a wide audience.\n\n<h2>Attention-Grabbing Title</h2>\n\nThe title is the first element readers see, so it should be concise and compelling. Aim to communicate the essence of your project in a way that piques curiosity and invites further exploration. Avoid overly technical jargon in the title, but ensure it's descriptive enough to reflect the project's main focus.\n\n<h2>Selecting a Hero/Banner Image</h2>\n\nA well-chosen banner or hero image helps set the tone for your publication. It should be relevant to your project and visually engaging, drawing attention while providing context. Use high-quality images that align with your content\u2019s theme\u2014whether it's a dataset visualization, a model architecture diagram, or an industry-related image.\n\n<h2>Use Headers and Subheaders</h2>\n\nHeaders and subheaders break up your content into digestible sections, improving readability and making it easier for readers to navigate your publication. Use a consistent hierarchy (e.g., h2 for primary sections, h3 for subsections) to create a clear structure. This also helps readers scan for specific information quickly.\n\n<h2>Visuals and Multimedia</h2>\n\nIncorporate visuals such as images, diagrams, and videos to complement your text. Multimedia elements can illustrate complex concepts, making your publication more engaging and accessible. Use visuals to break up long sections of text and help readers retain information.\n\n<h2>Breaking Text Monotony</h2>\n\nLarge blocks of text can overwhelm readers. Break up paragraphs with images, bullet points, or callouts. Vary sentence length to keep your content dynamic and engaging. Consider adding whitespace between sections to create breathing room and guide the reader\u2019s eye.\n\n<h2>Using Callouts and Info Boxes</h2>\n\nCallouts and info boxes help emphasize important points or provide additional context. Use these selectively to highlight key insights or offer helpful tips:\n\n\n:::tip{title=\"Tip\"}\n- **Tip**: Share helpful advice or shortcuts.\n\n:::\n:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n- **Note**: Provide additional information that complements the main text.\n:::\n:::caution{title=\"Caution\"}\n- **Caution**: Warn readers about potential pitfalls.\n:::\n:::warning{title=\"Warning\"}\n- **Warning**: Flag critical information or risks.\n:::\n\n<h2>Use Bullet Points and Numbered Lists (But Don't Overuse Them)</h2>\n\nBullet points and numbered lists are useful for organizing key ideas and steps. However, overusing them can make your publication feel fragmented. Use lists strategically to break down processes or summarize important points, but balance them with regular paragraphs to maintain flow.\n\n<h2>Incorporating Charts, Graphs, and Tables</h2>\n\nCharts, graphs, and tables are essential for presenting data and results clearly. Ensure they are labeled appropriately, with clear legends and titles. Use them to complement your text, not replace it. Highlight important trends or insights within the accompanying text to help readers understand their significance.\n\n<h2>Show Code Snippets, but Avoid Code Dumps</h2>\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to share your methodology, avoid overwhelming readers with large blocks of code. Instead, include code snippets that demonstrate key processes or algorithms, and link to your full codebase via a repository. \n\nBelow is an example of a useful code snippet to include. It demonstrates a custom loss function that was used in a project:\n\n```python\ndef loss_function(recon_x, x, mu, logvar):\n    BCE = F.binary_cross_entropy(recon_x, x, reduction='sum')\n    KLD = -0.5 * torch.sum(1 + logvar - mu.pow(2) - logvar.exp())\n    return BCE + KLD\n```\n\n<h2>Highlight Key Findings</h2>\n\nDon\u2019t bury your most important insights in lengthy sections. Use bold text, bullet points, or callouts to highlight key findings. Ensure that readers can quickly identify the main contributions or conclusions of your work.\n\n<h2>Use a Color Scheme for Charts</h2>\n\nConsistent use of colors in charts and graphs helps readers follow trends and comparisons. Pick a color scheme that is visually appealing, easy to read, and, if possible, consistent with your publication\u2019s theme. Avoid overly bright or clashing colors.\n\n<h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>\n\nMake your publication accessible to all readers by adopting basic accessibility principles. Use alt text for images, choose legible fonts, and ensure there is sufficient color contrast in your charts. Accessibility improves inclusivity and helps reach a broader audience.\n\n<h2> Image Aspect Ratio and Sizes</h2>\n\nWhen including images in your Ready Tensor publication, it\u2019s essential to maintain proper aspect ratios and image sizes to ensure your visuals are clear, engaging, and enhance the overall readability of your project. \n\nHere are some best practices for handling image dimensions:\n\n1. **Aspect Ratio**\nThe **aspect ratio** of an image is the proportional relationship between its width and height. Common aspect ratios include:\n\n   - **4:3**: Suitable for most charts, graphs, and screenshots.\n   - **4:1**: Ideal for hero images at the top of the publication.\n   - **16:9**: Commonly used for wider images, such as landscape photos or infographics.\n   - **1:1**: Ideal for icons, logos, or small visuals that need to appear square.\n   \n\n\nMaintaining a consistent aspect ratio across images in your publication can create a professional and uniform look. Distorted images (those stretched or compressed) can detract from the quality of your presentation, so it\u2019s important to ensure that any resizing preserves the original aspect ratio.\n\n 2. **Image Sizes**\nThe size of your images should balance clarity and file size. High-resolution images are critical for presenting details in charts, diagrams, and other visuals, but excessively large files can slow down loading times. Here are some recommendations:\n   - **Resolution**: Use images with at least **72 DPI (dots per inch)** for web display. For high-quality visuals, especially for detailed diagrams or charts, consider using images with **150 DPI or higher**.\n   - **File Size**: To optimize performance, aim for image sizes between **50KB to 200KB** where possible. Compress images without sacrificing quality to reduce file size, using formats like **JPEG** for photos or **PNG** for charts\n\n3. **Maintaining Clarity**\n   - **Avoid pixelation**: If you need to resize an image, make sure it doesn\u2019t become pixelated. Always scale down rather than up to maintain image sharpness.\n   - **Use vector graphics**: For diagrams or illustrations, consider using **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. SVG images maintain clarity at any size and are ideal for logos, icons, and simple diagrams.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you ensure that your images not only look good but also contribute effectively to the storytelling in your project, making it both visually appealing and easy to comprehend for your audience.\n\n--DIVIDER--# 6.

By training and testing models on the SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) dataset, we compare these approaches in terms of accuracy, loss, memory savings, and computational efficiency. The results demonstrate how PEFT methods can significantly reduce the computational burden and memory requirements without compromising performance, making them ideal for large-scale language models.--DIVIDER--# Introduction\n\nAs large language models continue to grow in size and complexity, the demand for efficient fine-tuning methods has increased dramatically. Traditional **full fine-tuning** approaches, which involve updating all model parameters, are resource-intensive and often impractical for large models due to memory and computational constraints. This challenge has led to the development of **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** methods, which allow for effective adaptation of pre-trained models while updating only a small fraction of the parameters.\n\nIn this article, we dive into four popular fine-tuning approaches:\n1. **Full Fine-Tuning**: The baseline approach where all model parameters are updated.\n\n2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A method that introduces trainable low-rank matrices to the model's weight matrices, reducing the number of updated parameters.\n\n3. **DoRA (Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A further optimized variant of LoRA that decomposes model weights for enhanced efficiency.\n\n4. **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A quantized version of LoRA that leverages 4-bit quantization to further reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.\n\nWe evaluate these techniques using the **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)** dataset, comparing their performance in terms of **accuracy**, **loss**, and **memory efficiency**. By the end of this article, readers will understand how PEFT methods can significantly reduce training costs while preserving or even improving model performance, making them an essential tool in the world of large-scale language models.\n--DIVIDER--# Full Fine-Tuning\n\n**Full Fine-Tuning** is the traditional approach to adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task. In this method, **all of the model's parameters are updated** during the fine-tuning process. This means that the pre-trained weights are not frozen; instead, they are adjusted to minimize the loss on the new dataset.\n\n<h4> How Full Fine-Tuning Works:</h4>\nIn full fine-tuning, the model is first initialized with pre-trained weights, typically from a large dataset (such as a language model trained on a diverse corpus). During fine-tuning, each of the model's parameters is updated based on the gradients computed for the task-specific dataset. This involves running backpropagation through the entire model, computing and applying gradients to all layers.\n\nSince the model's entire parameter set is modified, full fine-tuning can lead to optimal performance for the target task, as the model has the flexibility to fully adapt to the new data.\n\n<h4>Pros:</h4>\n\n- **High flexibility** : The model can learn highly specific patterns for the new task, potentially leading to the best performance, especially when the task differs significantly from the pre-training objective.\n\n- **State-of-the-art results**: Full fine-tuning has been used in numerous applications to achieve leading results across a variety of NLP benchmarks.\n\n<h4>Cons:</h4>\n\n- **Memory and computational cost**: Fine-tuning all the parameters of a large model (e.g., models with billions of parameters) requires a significant amount of GPU memory and computational power, making it impractical for many users without access to specialized hardware.\n\n- **Overfitting risk**: If the new dataset is small or very specific, full fine-tuning can lead to overfitting, as the model may overly adjust to the fine-tuning dataset, losing some of the benefits from pre-training.\n\nWhile full fine-tuning remains the baseline approach, it often becomes impractical as model sizes increase. This has motivated the development of **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** methods, which aim to reduce the number of parameters updated during fine-tuning, lowering computational requirements while still achieving high performance.\n--DIVIDER--# Overview of PEFT Approaches\n\n**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** methods offer a practical solution to the high computational and memory demands of full fine-tuning by updating only a fraction of the model\u2019s parameters. These methods are particularly useful for fine-tuning large pre-trained models with limited hardware resources. In this section, we briefly introduce three key PEFT approaches: **LoRA**, **DoRA**, and **QLoRA**.\n\n<h2> 1. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)</h2>\n\n**LoRA** introduces trainable, low-rank matrices to the model\u2019s weight matrices while freezing the core parameters. By only training the smaller, low-rank matrices, LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, making it highly efficient for large models. This technique has gained popularity for its ability to fine-tune models with significantly lower memory and computational requirements compared to full fine-tuning.\n\n<h2>2. DoRA (Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation)</h2>\n\n**DoRA** builds on the principles of LoRA but takes parameter efficiency further by decomposing weight matrices into low-rank components. This decomposition allows for even fewer trainable parameters while maintaining model performance. DoRA is designed for scenarios where memory efficiency is paramount, and fine-tuning needs to be performed with even less overhead.\n\n<h2>3. QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)</h2>\n\n**QLoRA** is a highly efficient fine-tuning method that combines the low-rank adaptation of LoRA with **quantization**, reducing the precision of the frozen weights (e.g., from 32-bit to 4-bit). This results in a dramatic reduction in memory usage while maintaining performance. QLoRA is particularly effective for fine-tuning large models on smaller hardware, making it one of the most memory-efficient methods available today.\n--DIVIDER--# LoRA \n\n\n\n**LoRA**  is a popular **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** method designed to reduce the computational and memory overhead associated with fine-tuning large pre-trained models. Instead of updating the entire set of model parameters, LoRA introduces small, trainable **low-rank matrices** to specific weight matrices, while freezing the original model weights. This allows for efficient fine-tuning without sacrificing much performance.\n\nThe main idea behind LoRA is that instead of fine-tuning all parameters, we assume that the weight updates during fine-tuning can be expressed as a low-rank matrix. This significantly reduces the number of parameters to train, leading to memory and time savings. LoRA is especially effective in large models where the number of parameters is massive, making traditional fine-tuning impractical.\n\nLoRA has been widely adopted for tasks that require fine-tuning massive models, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) applications. It has been proven to retain a high level of performance, even when only a small fraction of the parameters are updated. \n\n<h2> Advantages of LoRA:</h2>\n\n- **Reduced Memory Usage**: By only training the low-rank matrices, LoRA drastically reduces the memory footprint required for fine-tuning.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: LoRA reduces the number of parameters to be updated, leading to faster training times.\n- **Scalability**: LoRA can be applied to extremely large models, making it feasible to fine-tune models that were previously too large to handle with limited hardware.\n\nLoRA is a powerful tool in the fine-tuning toolbox, and it serves as the foundation for more advanced PEFT methods such as DoRA and QLoRA.\n\n--DIVIDER--<h2> Technical Implementation</h2>\n\nIn this section, we will walk through the **technical implementation** of the **LoRA** method applied to **GPT-2 Large**, specifically targeting the attention layers. The following implementation freezes the majority of the model\u2019s parameters and applies **low-rank adaptation matrices** to the attention layers, which are of type **`Conv1D`** in GPT-2.\n\nWe start by defining the LoRA layer and then recursively applying it to the relevant parts of the model.\n\n![lora-diagram.png](lora-diagram.png)\n\n<h2> LoRA Class </h2>\n\nThe first step is to create a custom `LoRA` class that decomposes the weight matrices into two smaller matrices **A** and **B**. The key is to modify the model by inserting these small, trainable matrices, which are later used during the fine-tuning process. \n\n```python\nclass LoRA(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, original_layer, alpha, rank=8):\n        super(LoRA, self).__init__()\n\n        # Store the original layer's weight\n        self.original_weight = original_layer.weight\n        self.alpha = alpha\n        self.rank = rank\n\n        in_features = original_layer.weight.shape[0]\n        out_features = original_layer.weight.shape[1]\n        \n        # Standard deviation for initialization\n        std_dev = 1 / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(rank).float())\n        \n        # Perform weight decomposition into two low-rank matrices A and B\n        # We initialize A and B with random values\n        self.A = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(in_features, rank) * std_dev)\n        self.B = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(rank, out_features))\n\n        # Freeze the original weight (it won't be updated)\n        self.original_weight.requires_grad = False\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Approximate the original weight as the product of A and B\n        low_rank_weight = self.alpha * torch.matmul(self.A, self.B)\n        adapted_weight = self.original_weight + low_rank_weight\n\n        # Apply the adapted weight to the input\n        return torch.matmul(x, adapted_weight)\n```\n\n <h3>Low-Rank Approximation</h3>\n\n Instead of training the full weight matrix, we introduce two smaller matrices, **A** and **B**, to approximate the weight updates in a low-rank form. The **rank** of these matrices controls their dimensions: \n\n**A** has dimensions $$ (in\\_features, rank) $$ \n**B** has dimensions $$ (rank, out\\_features) $$ \nwhere $$in\\_features$$ and $$out\\_features$$ correspond to the original weight matrix dimensions.\n\n Multiplying **A** and **B** gives a matrix with the same shape as the original weight matrix $$ (in\\_features, out\\_features) $$  This allows us to efficiently learn an approximation of the weight updates without training the entire matrix. Importantly, you can change the **rank** while maintaining the same output dimension. A **higher rank** captures more information and typically leads to **better performance**, but it also increases the **computational cost** and training time. Conversely, a **lower rank** reduces the memory and computational requirements but may lead to a loss in accuracy.<br><br>\n\n:::info{title=\"Info\"}\nSuppose you have the original weight matrix of size (1000x1000). This means that you have a million parameters in the original layer. If we approximate the matrix by decomposing it into two matrices of shape (1000, 8) and (8, 1000), you would only have 16000 trainable parameters. If you then multiply the two matrices, you get the original dimensions back. This way we approximated a million parameters using only 16000 parameters. In this case the rank is 8.\n:::\n\n\n<h3>Frozen Parameters</h3>\n\nThe original model\u2019s weight parameters are frozen (`requires_grad = False`), meaning they are not updated during fine-tuning. This significantly reduces memory usage and computational complexity because the majority of the model\u2019s parameters remain untouched during the fine-tuning process.<br><br>\n\n<h3>Forward Pass</h3>\n\nDuring the forward pass, the effective weight is computed as a combination of the frozen original weight matrix and the scaled product of the two low-rank matrices, A and B, where the alpha parameter controls the magnitude of this adaptation. This scaling helps balance the contribution of the low-rank update to the overall weight matrix. The adapted weight matrix is then applied to the input, allowing the model to leverage the learned low-rank adaptation for fine-tuning, while still retaining the pre-trained knowledge encoded in the frozen weights.\n\n\n\n<h2>Applying LoRA to GPT-2 Large</h2>\n\nNow that we have the `LoRA` class, we need to recursively apply it to the **attention layers** of the model, which are implemented as **`Conv1D`** layers in GPT-2.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers.pytorch_utils import Conv1D\n\ndef apply_peft_to_layer(module, alpha=4, rank=8, type='lora'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively applies LoRA/DoRA to the appropriate layers in the model.\n\n    Args:\n        module: The current module to examine and possibly replace.\n        alpha: Scaling factor for LoRA.\n        rank: The rank of the low-rank adaptation.\n        type: The type of PEFT to apply ('lora' or 'dora').\n\n    Returns:\n        None (modifies the module in place).\n    \"\"\"\n    peft_module = LoRA if type == 'lora' else DoRA\n    for name, child_module in module.named_children():\n        # We target the attention layers of GPT-2, which are Conv1D layers\n        if isinstance(child_module, Conv1D) and 'c_attn' in name:\n            # Replace the original attention layer with the LoRA-adapted layer\n            setattr(module, name, peft_module(child_module, alpha=alpha, rank=rank))\n\n        # If the module has children, apply the function recursively\n        if len(list(child_module.children())) > 0:\n            apply_peft_to_layer(child_module, alpha, rank, type)\n```\n\n- **Recursive Application**: This function navigates through the model's architecture, searching for attention layers (e.g., `c_attn`) that are implemented as `Conv1D` layers.<br><br>\n\n- **Conditional Replacement**: Once an attention layer is found, we replace it with the **LoRA-adapted** layer using the `setattr()` function. The `LoRA` layer only affects the specific parts of the model where it is applied, leaving the rest of the model unchanged.<br><br>\n\n- **Recursive Search**: The function checks for child layers and applies LoRA to any matching layers it finds recursively, ensuring that all attention layers in the model are adapted.<br><br>\n\n<h2>Model Modification and Loading</h2>\n\nFinally, we define a function to load a pre-trained GPT-2 model and apply LoRA to its attention layers.\n\n```python\ndef get_custom_peft_model(alpha=4, rank=8, type='lora'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Load the model and apply LoRA/DoRA recursively to all applicable layers.\n\n    Args:\n        model_name: The name of the model to load.\n        alpha: Scaling factor for LoRA.\n        rank: Rank for low-rank adaptation in LoRA.\n\n    Returns:\n        The model with LoRA applied.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Load the GPT-2 model and set the pad token ID\n    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, ignore_mismatched_sizes=True).to(device)\n    model.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id\n\n    # Freeze all model parameters except those in the LoRA layers\n    for param in model.parameters():\n        param.requires_grad = False\n\n    # Apply LoRA recursively to all relevant layers\n    apply_peft_to_layer(model, alpha=alpha, rank=rank, type=type)\n\n    return model\n```\n\n- **Loading the Model**: The `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` function loads a pre-trained **GPT-2 Large** model.<br><br>\n\n- **Freezing the Model**: Before applying LoRA, we freeze all of the model\u2019s parameters to ensure that only the LoRA layers will be updated during fine-tuning.<br><br>\n\n- **Recursive LoRA Application**: We apply the `apply_peft_to_layer()` function to recursively insert LoRA into the attention layers.\n\n<h2> Targeting the GPT-2 Attention Layers</h2>\n\nIn GPT-2, the attention mechanism is implemented using **`Conv1D`** layers in the transformer blocks. This code specifically targets the attention layers (`c_attn`) of GPT-2 Large, replacing them with LoRA-modified versions. This allows us to achieve fine-tuning by modifying only a fraction of the model's parameters while leveraging the pre-trained knowledge of the frozen layers.\n\n\n--DIVIDER--# DoRA\n\n**DoRA** is an extension of the **LoRA** method, offering even greater efficiency by applying a weight decomposition technique. Similar to LoRA, DoRA freezes the majority of the model's parameters and focuses on updating only small, trainable matrices. However, DoRA goes one step further by decomposing the weight matrices into two parts before applying low-rank adaptation, allowing for more granular control over the updates.\n\n<h3> Key Differences from LoRA</h3>\n\n\u2022\tIn LoRA, the entire weight update is approximated by the product of two low-rank matrices. In DoRA, the original weight matrix is first decomposed into two components: magnitude and direction. This decomposition separates the scaling factor (magnitude) from the orientation (direction) of the weight update, providing more control over the fine-tuning process and improving efficiency.\n\t\u2022\tThe decomposition into magnitude and direction allows for better adaptability in certain tasks, where a more detailed breakdown of the model\u2019s weights can lead to higher performance with fewer trainable parameters. Specifically, DoRA computes unit vectors to represent the direction of weight updates, while applying scaling through a magnitude factor.\n\nThe unit vector, which represents the direction, is computed by normalizing the low-rank matrix product. You can obtain the unit vector by diving the vector by its norm.\n\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}}{\\|\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}\\|}\n$$\n\nwhere $$\\mathbf{A}$$ and $$\\mathbf{B}$$ are the low-rank matrices, and $$\\mathbf{u}$$ is the unit vector representing the direction of the weight update.\n\nThe norm of a vector $$\\mathbf{X}$$ is given by:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{X}\\| = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}\n$$\n\n<h2> Technical Implementation</h2>\n\nThe technical implementation of DoRA builds upon the LoRA framework, but adds an additional decomposition step to the weight matrices.\n\n```python\nclass DoRA(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, original_layer, alpha, rank=8):\n        super(DoRA, self).__init__()\n        self.original_weight = original_layer.weight\n        self.alpha = alpha\n        self.rank = rank\n       \n        in_features = original_layer.weight.shape[0]\n        out_features = original_layer.weight.shape[1]\n\n        # Perform weight decomposition into two low-rank matrices A and B\n        # We initialize A and B with random values\n        std_dev = 1 / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(rank).float())\n        self.A = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(in_features, rank) * std_dev)\n        self.B = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(rank, out_features))\n        self.m = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1, out_features))\n\n        self.original_weight.requires_grad = False\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Approximate the original weight as the product of A and B\n        low_rank_weight = self.alpha * torch.matmul(self.A, self.B)\n        low_rank_weight_norm = low_rank_weight / (low_rank_weight.norm(p=2, dim=1, keepdim=True) + 1e-9)\n\n        # Add the original (frozen) weight back to the low-rank adaptation\n        low_rank_weight = self.m * low_rank_weight_norm\n        adapted_weight = self.original_weight + low_rank_weight\n\n        # Apply the adapted weight to the input\n        return torch.matmul(x, adapted_weight)\n```\n\n\n- **Decomposition Step**: An extra decomposition step is introduced with the `self.m` parameter, allowing the model to learn different **magnitudes** for the normalized weight updates. This provides more flexibility by decoupling the direction of the weight updates (captured by the low-rank matrices) from their magnitude, enabling finer control over the adaptation process.\n\n- **Forward Pass**: The adapted weight is still a combination of the frozen weight and the low-rank matrices, but with an additional scaling layer that offers more flexibility in weight updates.\n\n\nTo summarize, the key distinction between LoRA and DoRA lies in DoRA's decoupling of the magnitude and direction of the weight updates. This is achieved through the normalization of the low-rank matrices:\n\n```python\nlow_rank_weight_norm = low_rank_weight / (low_rank_weight.norm(p=2, dim=1, keepdim=True) + 1e-9)\nlow_rank_weight = self.m * low_rank_weight_norm\n```\n\nBy normalizing the weight updates and then scaling them with a learnable magnitude parameter (`self.m`), DoRA allows for more refined control over both the direction and magnitude of the weight updates, enhancing the model\u2019s ability to adapt to specific tasks.\n--DIVIDER--# QLoRA \n\n**QLoRA** builds on the foundation laid by **LoRA** and further improves efficiency by incorporating **quantization** techniques. By reducing the precision of the model\u2019s frozen parameters through quantization while keeping the low-rank adaptation matrices in higher precision, QLoRA dramatically reduces the memory and computational requirements without significantly affecting model performance.\n\nThe key idea behind QLoRA is to combine the low-rank adaptation from LoRA with **4-bit quantization** for the frozen parameters. This approach allows fine-tuning on large models even on hardware with limited memory resources, such as GPUs with smaller VRAM, by maintaining the core functionality of the model with fewer bits while still updating essential components with high precision.\n\n<h2> Key Features of QLoRA</h2>\n\n- **4-Bit Quantization**: QLoRA uses **4-bit quantization** for the frozen parameters of the model. This drastically reduces memory usage while retaining enough precision to preserve pre-trained knowledge.\n- **Higher-Precision Low-Rank Matrices**: The low-rank matrices (A and B) used for adaptation are kept in **FP16** or **FP32** precision, allowing QLoRA to achieve accurate fine-tuning results while reducing memory costs.\n\n<h2> Why QLoRA is Efficient</h2>\n\nBy quantizing the non-trainable parts of the model and focusing on higher precision for the small trainable matrices, QLoRA achieves extreme memory efficiency. This makes it possible to fine-tune extremely large models using commodity hardware, allowing for wider accessibility without compromising performance.\n\n--DIVIDER--<h2> Technical Implementation of QLoRA</h2>\n\nIn this section, we\u2019ll walk through the technical implementation of **QLoRA**, which combines **4-bit quantization** with **Low-Rank Adaptation** (LoRA) to achieve memory-efficient fine-tuning on large models. The goal is to quantize the frozen parameters of the model using **4-bit precision** while applying LoRA to specific layers, allowing the fine-tuning process to focus on a small set of trainable parameters.\n\n:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n<h1>BitsAndBytes</h1>\nBitsAndBytes is a library designed to enable efficient quantization of large language models, reducing memory usage while maintaining model performance. It supports 4-bit and 8-bit quantization, allowing models to run on hardware with limited resources, such as consumer-grade GPUs.\n\nYou can install it using :\n```\npip install -U bitsandbytes\n```\n:::\n\nThe following code demonstrates how we load a pre-trained model, apply **4-bit quantization**, and then incorporate **LoRA** to fine-tune the model.\n\n\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig\n\nmodel_name = \"openai-community/gpt2-large\"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nif tokenizer.pad_token is None:\n    tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token  # Using eos_token as the pad_token if it's not defined\n\n# Step 1: Load the model using 4-bit quantization\nquantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n    load_in_4bit=True,                # Enable 4-bit quantization\n    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,   # Use double quantization for accuracy\n    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,  # Use FP16 for computation during training/inference\n    bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",        # Normal float 4-bit quantization\n)\n\n# Step 2: Load the pre-trained model with the quantization configuration\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    quantization_config=quantization_config,  # Pass the quantization config\n    device_map=\"auto\",                        # Automatically map model to available devices (e.g., GPU)\n)\n\n# Set the padding token ID\nmodel.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id\n\n# Step 3: Apply LoRA to the quantized model\nmodel = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)\n```\n\n<h3> Breakdown of the Code</h3>\n\n1. **4-bit Quantization Configuration**:\n    - We create a `BitsAndBytesConfig` to enable 4-bit quantization by setting `load_in_4bit=True`. This ensures that the frozen model parameters are stored in a highly compressed form, using only 4 bits per parameter.\n    - **`bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True`** enables double quantization for better accuracy, and **`bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16`** ensures that the computations during training and inference are done in 16-bit floating-point precision (FP16).\n    - The **`bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\"`** specifies the quantization type as **normal float 4-bit** (NF4), which is known to provide better precision compared to standard 4-bit quantization methods.\n\n2. **Loading the Pre-trained Model**:\n    - The pre-trained model is loaded using `AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained` and mapped to the appropriate device (GPU or CPU) using **`device_map=\"auto\"`**.\n    - The model\u2019s frozen parameters are quantized to 4 bits, significantly reducing memory usage without sacrificing much accuracy. This allows for large models to be loaded on memory-limited devices, such as consumer-grade GPUs.\n\n3. **Applying LoRA**:\n    - After loading the quantized model, we apply **LoRA** using the `get_peft_model` function. This ensures that only a small set of trainable low-rank matrices is updated during fine-tuning, while the frozen, quantized weights remain untouched.\n    - The result is a memory-efficient fine-tuning process that still retains the performance benefits of the original pre-trained model.\n\n<h3> Why This Implementation is Efficient:</h3>\n\nBy combining 4-bit quantization with LoRA, QLoRA dramatically reduces the memory footprint required to fine-tune large models. The quantization of frozen weights ensures that memory usage is minimized, while LoRA allows fine-tuning to occur on a small set of trainable parameters, preserving performance while making fine-tuning feasible on hardware with limited resources.\n\n--DIVIDER--# PEFT in Action\n\nIn this section, we demonstrate **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** in action by comparing the performance and efficiency of the different approaches: **Full Fine-Tuning**, **LoRA**, **DoRA**, and **QLoRA**. We trained each of these methods on the **SST-2 dataset** and captured both the **model performance** (e.g., accuracy) and **running time** to highlight the trade-offs between each approach.\n\n:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n<h2>SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)</h2>\n\nThe **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)** dataset is a popular benchmark for **sentiment classification**. It consists of movie reviews, where each review is labeled as either **positive** or **negative**. The task involves classifying the sentiment of each review based on the text, making it a suitable dataset for evaluating the performance of natural language models.\n\nSST-2 is widely used for fine-tuning pre-trained models in NLP because of its simplicity and binary classification nature, providing a good baseline for comparing different model architectures and fine-tuning approaches.\n:::\n\nWe provide a [notebook](https://github.com/readytensor/rt_peft_publication/blob/master/peft.ipynb) showcasing the full training pipeline, including:\n- Loading the dataset and pre-trained models.\n- Applying each PEFT method.\n- Measuring training times and memory usage.\n- Evaluating the models' performance on the SST-2 dataset.\n\n<h3> Key Metrics</h3>\n\n- **Accuracy**: We evaluate how well each model performs in terms of sentiment classification on SST-2.\n- **Running Time**: This includes both training time and memory efficiency, particularly how PEFT methods reduce resource consumption while maintaining strong performance.\n- **Model Size**: For approaches like QLoRA, we observe significant reductions in model size due to quantization, allowing training on smaller hardware setups.\n\nBy comparing the results from these different approaches, we can demonstrate the **efficiency** and **scalability** benefits of PEFT methods, particularly for large models where full fine-tuning becomes impractical.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--## Execution Time\n\nWe compare the execution times of different fine-tuning approaches: **Full Fine-Tuning**, **LoRA**,  **DoRA**, and **QLoRA**. To make the comparison easier to interpret, we've normalized the execution times, with **Full Fine-Tuning** set to 100%.\n\nThe bar chart below illustrates the **relative execution times** for each approach. As expected, **Full Fine-Tuning** takes the longest time, since it updates all model parameters. In contrast, **LoRA**, **DoRA**, and **QLoRA** dramatically reduce execution times by focusing on a smaller set of parameters and applying techniques such as low-rank adaptation and quantization.\n\n![execution_times.png](execution_times.png)\n\n- **LoRA** and **DoRA** achieve significant reductions in execution time by freezing most model parameters and training only the low-rank matrices.\n- **QLoRA** goes even further by applying 4-bit quantization to the frozen parameters, offering the most efficient execution time among the approaches.\n\nThis comparison highlights how parameter-efficient methods like **LoRA**, **DoRA**, and **QLoRA** enable fast fine-tuning of large models, making them suitable for hardware with limited resources while maintaining competitive performance.\n\n\n--DIVIDER--## Model size\n\nWe compare the model size of the **Original Model** with the size after applying **QLoRA**. To visualize this, we\u2019ve created a diagram showing two circles representing the relative sizes of the models. The original model was **2.88GB**, and after applying QLoRA, the model size was reduced to just **0.46GB**\u2014which is only **16%** of the original size, thanks to quantization and low-rank adaptation.\n\nThis significant reduction in size comes with only a 4% drop in validation accuracy. The validation accuracy of full fine-tuning was 90%, while QLoRA achieved a comparable 86%, making this a highly efficient trade-off between model size and performance.\n\nThe plot below illustrates the significant reduction in model size achieved through QLoRA:\n\n![model_size_comparison_.png](model_size_comparison_.png)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that methods like **LoRA** and **DoRA** do not directly affect the overall model size, as they primarily modify how the model is fine-tuned by freezing most of the parameters and introducing trainable low-rank matrices. However, **QLoRA** achieves a significant size reduction by quantizing the frozen weights, making it much more memory-efficient.\n\n\n--DIVIDER--## Training Loss & Validation Accuracy\n\nNow let's compare the training loss and validation accuracy of different fine-tuning approaches, including Full Fine-Tuning, LoRA, DoRA, and QLoRA.\n\nThe plot below shows the training loss for each approach across multiple epochs. While Full Fine-Tuning achieves the lowest training loss, it doesn\u2019t necessarily result in the best validation accuracy. In fact, LoRA demonstrates better validation accuracy, even though its training loss is slightly higher.\n\n![loss_plot.png](loss_plot.png)\n\n\n![accuracy_comparison.png](accuracy_comparison.png)\n\nThis highlights a critical observation when working with smaller datasets: Full Fine-Tuning can lead to overfitting. It optimizes well on the training data (leading to lower training loss), but this can come at the cost of generalization to unseen validation data. On the other hand, methods like LoRA and QLoRA, which focus on updating fewer parameters, tend to generalize better, striking a balance between training performance and validation accuracy.\n\nBy using parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA, we can avoid overfitting and achieve stronger validation performance, making these approaches particularly effective for fine-tuning on small datasets.\n\n--DIVIDER--# Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we've explored several **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** approaches, including **LoRA**, **DoRA**, and **QLoRA**, and compared them to **Full Fine-Tuning**. Through our experiments, we observed key trade-offs in terms of model size, execution time, training loss, and validation accuracy.\n\n- **Full Fine-Tuning** delivered the lowest training loss, but it struggled with overfitting on smaller datasets, as shown by its lower generalization performance (validation accuracy).\n- **LoRA** and **DoRA** provided a significant reduction in training time and resource usage, with LoRA demonstrating better generalization and achieving higher validation accuracy than Full Fine-Tuning.\n- **QLoRA**, leveraging quantization and low-rank adaptation, offered the most memory-efficient fine-tuning approach, reducing model size by a staggering 84% while maintaining competitive accuracy.\n\nOverall, PEFT methods like LoRA and QLoRA offer a promising solution for fine-tuning large models on small datasets or limited hardware. They strike a balance between efficiency and performance, making them an attractive option for modern machine learning tasks.\n\nThese findings demonstrate the value of adopting parameter-efficient methods, especially when dealing with limited resources, without sacrificing model performance.--DIVIDER--# References\nHu, Edward J., et al.

We introduce a three-tiered evaluation system, namely, Essential, Professional, and Elite, to help practitioners assess and improve their code repositories at appropriate levels of rigor. The framework encompasses five critical categories: Documentation, Repository Structure, Environment and Dependencies, License and Legal considerations, and Code Quality. Drawing from industry standards and best practices, we provide concrete criteria, common pitfalls, and practical examples that enable AI practitioners, researchers, and students to create repositories that serve as valuable resources for both their creators and the wider community. By implementing these practices, contributors can enhance their professional portfolios while simultaneously advancing open science principles in the AI landscape.\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"INFO\"}\n# Repository Assessment Tool\nBefore diving into the framework details, try our open-source repository assessment tool. It analyzes your repository against the criteria in this article and provides an objective score with specific improvement recommendations.\n\n**Get started**: [Repository Assessment Tool](https://github.com/readytensor/rt-repo-assessment) \n\n**Note:** You'll need an OpenAI API key to run the assessment tool.\n:::--DIVIDER--# Introduction\nAI and machine learning have advanced dramatically through open collaboration. The field thrives on shared knowledge, with researchers and practitioners expected to contribute their work openly. For many, public repositories serve dual purposes: showcasing personal expertise and advancing collective understanding. Yet most shared repositories fall far short of professional standards that would make them truly valuable to the community. \n\nTake a moment to examine two different AI project repositories implementing the same ResNet18 image classification model:\n\n**Repository A**: https://github.com/readytensor/rt_img_class_jn_resnet18_exampleA\n**Repository B**: https://github.com/readytensor/rt_img_class_jn_resnet18_exampleB\n\n**What did you notice?**\n\nThe readme for Repository A contains a brief desription about the project. With no additional information related to pre-requisites, installation, implementation, and usage, visitors cannot determine how to use it or whether it's trustworthy. Most visitors spend less than 30 seconds on Repository A before moving on.\n\nRepository B provides clear organization and proper documentation. Visitors immediately understand what the project does and have enough information to use it effectively. Though both repositories contain the same technical work, one presents it in a way that builds trust and facilitates adoption.\n\n**Which repository would you want your name attached to?**\n\nThe reality is that many AI/ML projects resemble Repository A. This is a missed opportunity to showcase the work effectively and benefit the community. A poorly created repository creates a negative impression that can impact career opportunities, collaboration potential, and project adoption.\n\nThis article presents a comprehensive framework to help you create repositories that are not just functional but truly valuable \u2014 repositories that answer four crucial questions for visitors:\n\n1. **What is this about?** (Clear communication of purpose and capabilities)\n2. **Why should I care?** (Value proposition and applications)\n3. **Can I trust it?** (Demonstrated professionalism and quality)\n4. **Can I use it?** (Clear instructions and appropriate licensing)\n\nWe organize best practices into five categories with three tiers of implementation (Essential, Professional, and Elite), allowing you to match your effort to project needs and resource constraints. Whether you are a student showcasing class projects, a researcher publishing code alongside a paper, or a professional building tools for broader use, these guidelines will help you create repositories that enhance your professional portfolio and contribute meaningfully to the field.--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n**Important Note**  \n1. While this framework primarily targets AI/ML and data science projects, most concepts apply to software development repositories in general. The principles of good documentation, organization, and reproducibility benefit all code projects regardless of domain.\n2. Many criteria in the current framework are specifically designed for Python-based implementations, reflecting its prevalence in AI/ML work. Future iterations will expand to address the unique requirements of other languages such as R, JavaScript, and others.\n3. This article focuses on repository structure and sharing practices, not on AI/ML methodology itself. Even the most technically sound AI/ML project may fail to gain community adoption if it cannot be easily understood, trusted, and used by others. We aim to help you effectively share your work, not instruct you on how to conduct that work in the first place.\n:::--DIVIDER--\n# Why Well-Organized Repositories Matter\n\nFor AI/ML engineers and data scientists, the quality of your code repositories directly impacts your work efficiency, career progression, and contribution to the community in three fundamental ways:\n\n![repo-best-practices-benefits.jpg](repo-best-practices-benefits.jpg)\n\n**Time Savings Through Enhanced Usability**\nWell-structured repositories dramatically improve your own productivity by making your work reusable and maintainable. When you properly document and organize code, you avoid spending hours rediscovering how your own implementations work months later. Data scientists frequently report spending more time understanding and fixing old code than writing new solutions. Clean dependency management prevents environment reconstruction headaches, allowing you to immediately resume work on interesting problems rather than debugging configuration issues. This organization also makes your code extensible\u2014when you want to build on previous work, add features, or adapt models to new datasets, the foundation is solid and understandable.\n\n**Career Advancement Through Professional Demonstration**\nYour repositories serve as concrete evidence of your professional capabilities. Hiring managers and potential collaborators regularly evaluate GitHub profiles when assessing candidates, often placing repository quality on par with technical skills. A well-organized repository demonstrates not just coding ability but also production readiness, attention to detail, and consideration for users - all qualities highly valued in professional settings. Many data scientists find that quality repositories lead to unexpected opportunities: conference invitations, collaboration requests, and interview offers frequently come from people who discovered their well-structured work. In a field where practical implementation matters as much as theoretical knowledge, your repositories form a crucial part of your professional identity.\n\n**Community Impact Through Accessible Knowledge**\nThe collective advancement of AI/ML depends on shared implementations and reproducible research. When you create quality repositories, you help others avoid reinventing solutions to common problems, allowing the field to progress more rapidly. Consider the frustration you have experienced trying to implement papers with missing details or the hours spent making someone else's code work. Your well-organized repository prevents others from facing these same challenges. Repositories that clearly answer what the project does, why it matters, whether it can be trusted, and how to use it become valuable community resources rather than one-time demonstrations. Every properly structured repository contributes to building a more collaborative, efficient AI ecosystem.\n\nInvesting time in repository quality is not about perfectionism \u2014 it is about practical benefits that directly affect your daily work, career trajectory, and impact on the field. The framework presented in this article provides a structured approach to realizing these benefits in your own projects.\n--DIVIDER--# Best Practices Framework\n\nThe AI repository best practices framework provides a structured approach to organizing and documenting code repositories for AI and machine learning projects. It establishes clear standards across five critical categories, with tiered implementation levels to accommodate different project stages and requirements.\n\n## Framework Structure\n\nThe framework organizes best practices into five main categories:\n\n1. **Documentation**: The written explanations and guides that help users understand and use your project\n2. **Repository Structure**: The organization of directories and files within your repository\n3. **Environment and Dependencies**: The specification of software requirements and configuration needed to run your code\n4. **License and Legal**: The permissions and terms governing the use of your code and associated assets\n5. **Code Quality**: The technical standards and practices applied to your codebase\n\nEach category contains specific criteria that can be assessed to determine if a repository meets established standards. Rather than presenting these as an all-or-nothing requirement, the framework defines three progressive tiers of implementation:\n\n## Implementation Tiers\n\nThe best practices framework is structured into three tiers of implementation - Essential, Professional, and Elite.  You can select the tier that aligns with your project goals, audience expectations, and available resources.\n\n![implementation-tiers.jpg](implementation-tiers.jpg)\n\n| **Tier** | **Definition** | **Key Characteristics** | **Appropriate For** |\n|------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| **Essential** | Minimum standards for usefulness | \u2022 Basic understandability for first-time visitors<br>\u2022 Sufficient information for technical users<br>\u2022 Basic organizational structure | \u2022 Personal projects<br>\u2022 Course assignments<br>\u2022 Early-stage research code<br>\u2022 Proof-of-concept implementations |\n| **Professional** | Comprehensive documentation and organization | \u2022 Detailed guidance for various users<br>\u2022 Consistent structure and organization<br>\u2022 Complete environment specifications<br>\u2022 Established coding standards<br>\u2022 Testing frameworks and documentation | \u2022 Team projects<br>\u2022 Open-source projects with contributors<br>\u2022 Published research code<br>\u2022 Professional portfolio work<br>\u2022 Small production-quality projects |\n| **Elite** | Best-in-class practices | \u2022 Comprehensive project documentation<br>\u2022 Meticulous logical structures<br>\u2022 Robust dependency management<br>\u2022 Complete legal compliance<br>\u2022 Advanced quality assurance | \u2022 Major open-source projects<br>\u2022 Production-level repositories<br>\u2022 Research code for broad adoption<br>\u2022 Reference implementations |\n\nThe tiered structure allows for incremental implementation, with each level building on the previous one. This progressive approach makes the framework accessible to projects of different scales and maturity levels.\n\nThe framework is not prescriptive about specific technologies or tools, focusing instead on the underlying principles of good repository design. This flexibility allows it to be applied across different programming languages, AI/ML frameworks, and project types.\n--DIVIDER--\nThe criteria fall under 5 main categories. These are: Documentation, Repository Structure, Environment and Dependencies, License and Legal, and Code Quality. \n\n![5-components.jpeg](5-components.jpeg)\n\nEach criterion in the framework is designed to be objectively assessable, making it possible to evaluate repositories systematically. This assessment can be conducted manually or through automated tools that check for the presence of specific files, structural patterns, or documentation elements.\n\nIn the following sections, we will explore each category in detail, examining specific criteria, providing examples, and offering implementation guidance for each tier.--DIVIDER--## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is the foundation of a user-friendly repository, serving as the primary interface between your code and its potential users. Well-crafted documentation answers fundamental questions about your project: what it does, why it matters, how to use it, and what to expect from it.\n\nUnfortunately, documentation is often treated as an afterthought, creating immediate barriers to adoption. The following chart lists the common pitfalls in documentation.\n\n![documentation-pitfalls.jpg](documentation-pitfalls.jpg)\n\nMany repositories suffer from missing or minimal README files, leaving users with no understanding of project purpose or functionality. Others lack clear installation instructions, causing users to encounter confusing errors during setup. Without usage examples, users cannot verify if the implementation meets their needs. Undocumented prerequisites and methodologies further compound these issues, leaving critical information hidden until users encounter mysterious failures.\n\nThe documentation component of our framework addresses these challenges through a structured approach that scales with project complexity. The following chart lists the criteria for Essential, Professional, and Elite documentation tiers, guiding you to create effective documentation that meets user needs at every level.\n\n--DIVIDER--\n![Documentation.svg](Documentation.svg)\n\nDetailed definitions of each of the criteria are provided in the document titled `Ready Tensor Repository Assessment Framework v1.pdf` available in the **Resources** section of this publication.  \n--DIVIDER--Let's explore the key principles of documentation at each tier.\n\n**Essential Documentation** provides the minimum information needed for basic understanding and use. It answers \"What is this project?\", \"Can I use it?\", and \"How do I use it?\" \u2014 enabling quick evaluation and adoption with minimal friction.\n\n**Professional Documentation** supports serious adoption by providing comprehensive setup instructions, detailed usage guides, and technical specifications. It addresses users who plan to incorporate your work into their projects, answering \"How does this work under different conditions?\" and \"What configuration options exist?\" Professional documentation also demonstrates trustworthiness for production environments by incorporating testing procedures, error handling approaches, and other reliability features that signal production readiness.\n\n**Elite Documentation** fosters a sustainable ecosystem around your project through contribution guidelines, change tracking, and contact information. It creates pathways for collaboration, answering \"How can I contribute?\" and \"How is this project evolving?\"\n\nEffective documentation transforms your repository from personal code storage into a valuable community resource, significantly increasing your project's accessibility, adoption, and impact regardless of its scale.\n--DIVIDER--## Repository Structure\n\nA well-organized repository structure provides a solid foundation for your AI/ML project, making it easier for users to navigate, understand, and contribute to your code. Proper structure serves as a visual map of your project's architecture and components, guiding users through your implementation.\n\nPoorly organized AI/ML repositories create significant barriers to understanding and use. The following chart illustrates common pitfalls in repository structure.\n\n![repo-structure-pitfalls.jpg](repo-structure-pitfalls.jpg)\n\nAI/ML project repositories often exhibit a chaotic root directory filled with dozens of unrelated files, making it difficult to identify entry points or understand the project's organization. Code, configuration, and data files might be randomly mixed together without logical separation. Inconsistent or confusing naming conventions create additional cognitive load for new users trying to understand the codebase. Many repositories also lack clear boundaries between different components, such as model definition, data processing, and evaluation code.\n\nTo address repository organization challenges, our framework offers systematic guidelines that adapt to project size. The chart below presents Essential, Professional, and Elite structure criteria, designed to help you create intuitive and maintainable organization.\n\n![Repository Structure Criteria.svg](Repository%20Structure%20Criteria.svg)\n\nLet's explore the key principles of repository structure at each tier.\n\n**Essential Structure** provides the minimum level of organization needed for basic navigation and understanding. It establishes a basic modular organization with logical separation of files, consistent and descriptive naming conventions for files and directories, a properly configured .gitignore file, and clearly identifiable entry points. This level focuses on answering \"Where do I find what I need?\" and \"How do I start using this?\"\n\n**Professional Structure** enhances navigability and maintainability through specific separation of components. It organizes code in dedicated module structures (such as src/ directories with submodules), places data in designated directories, separates configuration from code, and organizes notebooks, tests, documentation, and assets in their own logical locations. Professional repositories maintain appropriate directory density (under 15 files per directory) and reasonable directory depth (no more than 5 levels deep). They also properly isolate environment configuration files and dependency management structures. This level signals that the project is built for serious use and collaboration.\n\n**Elite Structure** builds on the Professional tier with the same organizational principles applied at a higher standard of consistency and completeness. The Elite structure maintains all the same criteria as Professional repositories but with greater attention to detail and thoroughness across all components. This comprehensive organization demonstrates adherence to industry best practices, making the project immediately familiar to experienced developers.\n\nA thoughtfully designed repository structure communicates professionalism and attention to detail, significantly reducing the barrier to entry for new users while improving maintainability for contributors. It transforms your repository from a personal collection of files into an accessible, professional software project that others can confidently build upon.\n--DIVIDER--## Environment and Dependencies\n\nProper environment and dependency management is critical for ensuring that AI/ML projects can be reliably reproduced and used by others. This aspect of repository design directly impacts whether users can successfully run your code without frustrating setup issues or unexpected behavior.\n\nMany repositories fail to adequately address environment configuration, leading to the infamous \"works on my machine\" problem. The following chart highlights common pitfalls in environment and dependency management.--DIVIDER--\n![environment-and-dependency-pitfalls.jpg](environment-and-dependency-pitfalls.jpg)--DIVIDER--Dependency management problems appear when repositories fail to specify required libraries clearly, forcing users to guess which packages they need. When dependencies do appear, they often lack version numbers, creating compatibility problems as package APIs evolve. Missing documentation about Python version requirements or hardware dependencies leads to confusing errors when users attempt to run code in unsuitable environments.\n\nThe environment and dependencies section of our framework provides solutions that grow with project sophistication. Below are the tiered criteria (Essential, Professional, and Elite) that guide reproducible environment setup.--DIVIDER--\n![Environment and Dependencies Criteria.svg](Environment%20and%20Dependencies%20Criteria.svg)--DIVIDER--\nLet's explore the key principles of environment and dependency management at each tier.\n\n**Essential Environment Management** provides the minimum information needed for basic reproducibility. It clearly lists all project dependencies in standard formats such as requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml. This level focuses on answering \"What packages do I need to install?\" allowing users to at least attempt to recreate the necessary environment.\n\n**Professional Environment Management** enhances reproducibility and ease of setup by pinning specific dependency versions to ensure consistent behavior across installations. It organizes dependencies into logical groups (core, dev, test) through separate requirement files or configuration options. Professional repositories specify required Python versions and include configuration for virtual environments such as environment.yml (conda), Pipfile (pipenv), or poetry.lock (poetry). This level provides confidence that the project can be reliably set up and run in different environments.\n\n**Elite Environment Management** optimizes for complete reproducibility and deployment readiness. It provides exact environment specifications through lockfiles, documents GPU-specific requirements including CUDA versions when applicable, and includes containerization through Dockerfiles or equivalent solutions. This comprehensive approach ensures that users can recreate the exact execution environment regardless of their underlying system, eliminating \"it works on my machine\" issues entirely.\n\nProper environment and dependency management transforms your repository from a collection of code that runs only in specific conditions into a reliable, reproducible project that users can confidently deploy in their own environments. This attention to reproducibility demonstrates professional rigor and significantly increases the likelihood that others will successfully use and build upon your work.\n--DIVIDER--## License and Legal\n\nProper licensing and legal documentation is a critical aspect of AI/ML repositories that is frequently overlooked. Without clear licensing, potential users cannot determine whether they can legally use, modify, or build upon your work, regardless of its technical quality.\n\nMany repositories either omit licenses entirely or include inappropriate licenses for their content. The following chart highlights common pitfalls in licensing and legal aspects.--DIVIDER--\n![license-legal-pitfalls.jpg](license-legal-pitfalls.jpg)--DIVIDER--Legal issues arise when repositories operate without licenses, creating ambiguity that prevents use by organizations with compliance concerns. Some repositories include licenses that conflict with their dependencies, while others neglect the unique legal aspects of AI/ML work regarding data and model rights. The absence of copyright notices and unclear terms for incorporated datasets or pretrained models further complicates legitimate use.\n\nFor proper licensing and legal considerations, our framework provides clear benchmarks at varying complexity levels. The following chart presents Essential, Professional, and Elite tier criteria for legal compliance and clarity.--DIVIDER--\n![License and Legal Criteria.svg](License%20and%20Legal%20Criteria.svg)--DIVIDER--\nLet's explore the key principles of licensing and legal documentation at each tier.\n\n**Essential Legal Documentation** ensures that users can determine basic usage rights. It includes a recognized license file (LICENSE, LICENSE.md, or LICENSE.txt) in the root directory that explicitly states terms of use, modification, and distribution. The chosen license must be appropriate for the project's purpose, dependencies, and intended use, avoiding unclear or conflicting terms. This level answers the fundamental question: \"Am I legally permitted to use this?\"\n\n**Professional Legal Documentation** enhances legal clarity by addressing AI/ML-specific concerns. In addition to proper licensing, it includes clear documentation of data usage rights, stating ownership, licensing, compliance requirements, and restrictions for any datasets used or referenced. Similarly, it documents model usage rights, specifying ownership, licensing terms, and redistribution policies for any ML models included or referenced. This level provides confidence that the project can be legally used in professional contexts.\n\n**Elite Legal Documentation** establishes a comprehensive legal framework supporting long-term community engagement. It builds on the Professional tier by adding explicit copyright statements in source files and documentation to prevent ambiguity in legal rights and attribution. Elite repositories also include a Code of Conduct that outlines contributor behavior expectations, enforcement mechanisms, and reporting guidelines to foster an inclusive and respectful environment. This level demonstrates commitment to professional standards and community values.\n\nProper licensing and legal documentation transforms your repository from a potentially risky resource into a legally sound project that organizations and individuals can confidently incorporate into their work. This attention to legal concerns removes a significant barrier to adoption and signals professionalism to potential users and contributors.--DIVIDER--## Code Quality\n\nCode quality is the foundation of maintainable, reliable AI/ML projects. While functional code can deliver results, high-quality code enables long-term sustainability, collaboration, and trust in your implementation.\n\nIn AI/ML repositories, functionality frequently takes precedence over quality, resulting in maintainability and reliability issues. The following chart highlights common code quality pitfalls.--DIVIDER--\n![code-quality-pitfalls.jpg](code-quality-pitfalls.jpg)--DIVIDER--Code quality issues manifest in sprawling, monolithic scripts that defy debugging efforts. Excessive function length and high cyclomatic complexity make maintenance difficult. The prevalence of hardcoded values, minimal error handling, and lack of tests results in brittle, unpredictable code. In the AI/ML context, missing random seed settings compromise reproducibility, while poorly documented notebooks obscure the development process.--DIVIDER--Our framework tackles code quality through graduated standards appropriate for different project stages. The chart below details the Essential, Professional, and Elite criteria that promote maintainable, reliable code as projects evolve--DIVIDER--\n![Code Quality Criteria.svg](Code%20Quality%20Criteria.svg)--DIVIDER--Let's explore the key principles of code quality at each tier.\n\n**Essential Code Quality** establishes basic maintainability by organizing code into functions and methods rather than monolithic scripts, keeping individual scripts under 500 lines, and implementing basic error handling through try/except blocks. It uses dedicated configuration files to separate parameters from code logic and sets random seeds to ensure reproducibility. For notebooks, it maintains reasonable cell length (under 100 lines) and includes markdown documentation (at least 10% of cells). This level provides the minimum quality needed for others to understand and use your code.\n\n**Professional Code Quality** significantly enhances maintainability and reliability by implementing comprehensive best practices. Functions are kept under 50 lines, code duplication is limited, and hardcoded constants are minimized. Professional repositories use environment variables for sensitive configurations, implement logging, include tests with framework support, and provide docstrings with parameter and return documentation. They also implement type hints, use style checkers for consistent formatting, control function complexity, and include data validation. For notebooks, they import custom modules and manage output cells properly. This level demonstrates serious software engineering practices.\n\n**Elite Code Quality** takes quality to production-grade standards by adding advanced practices such as comprehensive logging configuration, custom exception classes, and test coverage metrics. These repositories represent the highest standard of code quality, suitable for critical production environments and long-term maintenance.\n\nHigh-quality code communicates professionalism and reliability, significantly increasing confidence in your implementation. This attention to quality transforms your repository from working code into trustworthy software that others can confidently build upon, adapt, and maintain over time.\n--DIVIDER--# Implementation Guide with Examples\n\nThe following steps outline a practical approach to creating high-quality AI/ML project repositories. For detailed examples of repository structures and README templates at each implementation tier, see **Appendix A: Sample Repository Structures** and **Appendix B: Sample README Structures**.\n\n### Step 1: Select an Appropriate Template\n\nChoose a repository structure that matches your project complexity and goals:\n\n- **Essential**: For personal projects, educational demonstrations, or proof-of-concepts\n- **Professional**: For team projects, research code intended for publication, or open-source contributions\n- **Elite**: For production systems, major open-source projects, or reference implementations\n\nRefer to **Appendix A: Sample Repository Structures** for detailed examples at each tier. Customize these templates to fit your specific needs while maintaining the core organizational principles. Remember that even a small project can benefit from good structure.\n\n### Step 2: Choose the Right License\n\nSelect a license appropriate for your project's content and intended use:\n\n- **MIT License**: Permissive license good for most software projects, allowing commercial use\n- **Apache 2.0**: Similar to MIT but with patent protections\n- **GPL (v3)**: Strong copyleft license requiring derivative works to be open-sourced\n- **Creative Commons**: Various options for non-software content like datasets or documentation\n\nConsider the licenses of your dependencies, as they may constrain your options. Ensure your license is compatible with the libraries and frameworks you use.\n\n### Step 3: Implement Environment and Dependency Management\n\nChoose the appropriate dependency management approach for your project:\n\n- **Essential**: `requirements.txt` listing direct dependencies\n- **Professional**: \n  - Pinned version numbers (`numpy==1.21.0` instead of just `numpy`)\n  - Separated requirements files for different purposes\n  - Virtual environment configuration (conda, venv, etc.)\n- **Elite**:\n  - Lockfiles for exact reproduction (poetry.lock, Pipfile.lock)\n  - Containerization with Docker\n  - Environment variables for configuration\n\nDocument any non-Python dependencies or system requirements clearly in your README.\n\n### Step 4: Create a Structured README\n\nDevelop a README that matches your target implementation tier. A well-structured README is critical as it's often the first thing visitors see when discovering your project.\n\nWhen creating your README:\n\n- Focus on answering the four key questions: what the project is about, why users should care, whether they can trust it, and how they can use it\n- Match the detail level to your target tier (Essential, Professional, or Elite)\n- Include examples and code snippets where appropriate\n- Consider adding screenshots or diagrams for visual clarity\n\nRefer to **Appendix B: Sample README Structures** for detailed templates at each implementation tier, from basic structures covering essential information to comprehensive documents that support serious adoption and community engagement.\n\n### Step 5: Follow Coding Best Practices\n\nAdopt established coding standards appropriate for your language:\n\n- **Python**:\n  - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (consistent indentation, naming conventions, etc.)\n  - Use type hints for function signatures\n  - Write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions\n  - Consider using linters and formatters (black, flake8, pylint)\n\n- **Markdown**:\n  - Use proper heading hierarchy\n  - Include code blocks with language specification\n  - Use lists, tables, and emphasis consistently\n  - Add alt text to images for accessibility\n\n- **General Practices**:\n  - Keep functions small and focused on a single task\n  - Write descriptive variable and function names\n  - Include comments explaining \"why\" not just \"what\"\n  - Control script and function length\n  - Set random seeds for reproducibility in AI/ML code\n\nFor a comprehensive list of relevant tools and references, see the **Additional Resources** section at the end of this article, which includes links to code style guides, repository templates, documentation tools, and dependency management solutions.--DIVIDER--# Tools and Resources\n\nThe following tools can significantly reduce the effort required to implement best practices in your repositories:\n\n## Documentation Tools\n\n- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/): Python documentation generator\n- [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/): Documentation hosting platform\n- [Markdown Guide](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/LX9cbIx7mQs9): Project documentation with Markdown\n- [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/): Create publication-quality books from notebooks\n- [Docstring Conventions](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/DM3Ao23CIocT): Guide for Python docstrings\n\n## Repository Structure and Templates\n\n- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter): Project template tool\n- [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science): Template for data science projects\n- [PyScaffold](https://github.com/pyscaffold/pyscaffold): Project generator for Python packages\n- [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/): Create Python packages from Jupyter notebooks\n\n## Dependency Management\n\n- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): Fast Python package installer and resolver\n- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): Python packaging and dependency management\n- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/): Package and environment management system\n- [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools): Set of tools for managing pip-compiled requirements\n- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/): Python development workflow tool\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): Containerization platform\n\n## Code Quality and Testing\n\n- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): Git hook scripts manager\n- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/): Uncompromising Python code formatter\n- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/): Python code linter\n- [Pylint](https://pylint.org/): Python static code analysis tool\n- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/): Static type checker for Python\n- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/): Python testing framework\n- [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/): Code coverage measurement for Python\n\n## License Resources\n\n- [License Guide](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/qWBpwY20fqSz): A primer on licenses for ML projects\n- [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/): Help picking an open source license\n- [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses): License information and standards\n- [TL;DR Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/): Software licenses explained in plain English\n- [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/): Licenses for non-code assets\n\n## Style Guides and Standards\n\n- [PEP 8](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/pCgumBWFPD90): Style Guide for Python Code\n- [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html): Comprehensive style guide\n- [Docstrings Guide](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/DM3Ao23CIocT): Python Docstrings for Machine Learning code\n\nThese tools address different aspects of repository quality, offering options for projects of all scales.

The rubric evaluates publications through four fundamental questions: What is this about? (Purpose), Why does it matter? (Value/Impact), Can I trust it? (Technical Quality), and Can I use it? (Documentation).\n\nThe system uses a binary scoring method (met/not met) across different criteria tailored to four main publication categories: Research & Academic Publications, Educational Content, Real-World Applications, and Technical Assets. Each category has specific requirements based on its purpose, with clear positive and negative indicators for objective assessment.\n\nThe rubric serves multiple audiences:\n\n- Authors can use it to ensure their work meets quality standards\n- Reviewers can apply consistent evaluation criteria\n- Readers can understand what to expect from different publication types\n\nWhile meeting the rubric's criteria establishes baseline quality, exceptional publications often demonstrate unique insights, innovative approaches, or significant practical impact beyond these basic requirements.--DIVIDER--# 1. Introduction\n\nTechnical publications in AI and data science need objective ways to assess their quality and effectiveness. Authors want to know if their publications meet quality standards. Readers want to know if a publication will serve their needs. Reviewers need consistent ways to evaluate submissions.\n\nThis document presents an evaluation rubric that addresses these needs. The rubric examines each publication through four key questions:\n\n1. What is this about? - Evaluates clarity of purpose and scope\n2. Why does it matter? - Assesses significance and value to readers\n3. Can I trust it? - Examines technical credibility and validation\n4. Can I use it? - Measures practical usability and completeness\n\nBy answering these questions systematically, the rubric provides clear criteria for measuring technical quality across different publication types. Authors can use it to create better publications. Reviewers can apply it for consistent evaluation.--DIVIDER--## 1.1 Purpose of the Rubric\n\nPublications on Ready Tensor serve diverse purposes - from advancing research to teaching concepts to documenting solutions. This evaluation rubric ensures each publication effectively serves its purpose by examining four key aspects: clarity of purpose, significance, technical credibility, and practical usability.\n\nAuthors can use this rubric to understand what makes their publications effective. By addressing the core questions - what is this about, why does it matter, can I trust it, can I use it - authors ensure their work provides clear value to readers.\n\nThe rubric uses a binary scoring system. Each criterion is marked as either met or not met based on specific evidence. This approach provides:\n\n- Objective measurement through clear evidence requirements\n- Consistent evaluation across different reviewers\n- Specific feedback on areas needing improvement\n- Easy verification of publication completeness\n\nFor publication competitions, this rubric helps identify quality submissions. While meeting these criteria establishes baseline quality, exceptional publications often demonstrate unique insights, innovative approaches, or significant practical impact beyond the baseline requirements.--DIVIDER--## 1.2 Relationship to Publication Best Practices Guide from Ready Tensor\n\nThe evaluation rubric works alongside the Ready Tensor Best Practices Guide:\n\n1. [Best Practices Guide](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/engage-and-inspire-best-practices-for-publishing-on-ready-tensor-SBgkOyUsP8qQ) - Focuses on how to present content effectively through clear writing, good organization, and visual elements\n\n2. This Evaluation Rubric - Provides criteria and scoring methodology for evaluating technical quality, completeness, and effectiveness\n\nAuthors should use both documents. Follow the Best Practices Guide for effective presentation while ensuring your work meets all rubric criteria.--DIVIDER--\n## 1.3 Using the Evaluation Rubric\n\nThe evaluation rubric divides technical publications into different types, each with its own specific evaluation criteria. These publication types and their detailed criteria are covered in later sections of this document.\n\nThe rubric uses binary scoring (met/not met) for individual criteria to provide a structured framework for evaluation. While total scores help indicate technical quality and completeness, they should not be used for direct comparisons between different publication types. For example, a research paper scoring 41 out of 45 criteria should not be compared with a tutorial scoring 16 out of 18 criteria, as they serve different purposes and are evaluated against different standards.\n\nEven within the same publication type, scores alone don't determine absolute quality rankings. A publication with a lower score might be more valuable due to unique insights or innovative approaches. The rubric should be viewed as a supportive tool for ensuring quality standards while recognizing that excellence can take many forms.\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"A note on competitions\"}\nWhile the evaluation criteria described in this publication help identify quality publications, exceptional work often goes beyond meeting basic requirements. Innovation, insight, and practical value play important roles in final evaluations.\n:::--DIVIDER--# 2. Evaluation Rubric Overview\n\nThe evaluation rubric assesses publications by answering four fundamental questions that apply across all technical publications on Ready Tensor.\n--DIVIDER--\n## 2.1 Core Questions\n\n**What is this about? (Purpose)**\n\nEvery publication must clearly state what readers will get from it. This means defining the scope, objectives, and intended outcomes up front. Purpose clarity helps readers immediately understand if the publication meets their needs.\n\n**Why does it matter? (Value/Impact)**\n\nPublications must establish their significance and value proposition. Readers should understand the practical, technical, or theoretical importance of the work.\n\n**Can I trust it? (Technical Quality)**\n\nAll content must be technically sound. While the depth and nature of validation vary by publication type, technical accuracy and proper substantiation of claims are universal requirements. This ensures readers can confidently use or build upon the work.\n\n**Can I use it? (Documentation)**\n\nContent should be properly documented for its intended purpose. The type of documentation varies with publication type, but all content must provide sufficient information for readers to achieve the stated purpose.--DIVIDER--\n## 2.2 Binary Assessment Approach\n\nEvaluators apply criteria mapped to the  four fundamental  questions, with requirements appropriate to each publication type. A binary scoring system (met/not met) ensures clear, objective assessment:\n\n- Met: Clear evidence present in the publication\n- Not Met: Missing or inadequate evidence\n\nFor a criterion to be met, evaluators must see clear evidence within the publication. For example, a \"clear statement of purpose\" needs an explicit purpose statement in the introduction. \"Proper citation of sources\" means all technical claims have specific references.\n\nWhen a criterion is not met, evaluators identify specific gaps or inadequacies, making it clear what authors need to improve.\n\nThe rubric recognizes that publications serve different purposes. Success means effectively delivering value within the publication's intended scope.\n--DIVIDER--## 2.3 Evidence-Based Evaluation\n\nEvaluators assess criteria based on evidence found within the publication and its linked resources. Evidence must be verifiable - evaluators must be able to examine and validate claims directly.\n\n**Technical Documentation**  \nEvaluators look for citations, equations, methodology descriptions, experimental results, and other technical content that substantiates claims and demonstrates rigor. Claims based on proprietary or closed-source methods require additional supporting evidence to be considered verified.\n\n**Visual Evidence**  \nDiagrams, graphs, screenshots, and demo videos help communicate complex concepts and demonstrate real implementations. While visual evidence supports understanding, key technical claims must be backed by verifiable technical documentation.\n\n**Code Evidence**  \nCode repositories, samples, installation instructions, and API documentation demonstrate implementation details and enable practical use. Open-source code allows direct verification of claims about functionality and performance. For closed-source tools, claims must be clearly scoped to what can be externally verified.\n\n**Data Evidence**  \nData repositories, files, and quality metrics provide concrete support for claims and enable result verification. Publicly accessible datasets allow direct validation. For proprietary datasets, publications must document data characteristics and quality measures that can be independently assessed.\n\nEach criterion is assessed as met (1 point) or not met (0 points) based on the presence and quality of verifiable evidence. The types of evidence required vary by publication type and specific criteria. Claims that cannot be verified through available evidence do not meet assessment criteria.--DIVIDER--## 2.4 Publication Type Adaptations\n\nThe evaluation framework adapts its specific criteria to match the purpose of each publication type while maintaining the core questions. A research publication requires rigorous methodology and validation but may not need deployment guides. A tutorial needs clear step-by-step instructions but may not need statistical analysis. An industry case study demands business impact evidence but may not need mathematical proofs.\n\nFor each publication type, criteria are selected to evaluate what matters most for that content's purpose and audience. Research publications focus on methodology, validation, and novel contributions. Educational content emphasizes clarity, completeness, and practical application. Industry publications prioritize real-world impact and implementation guidance. Technical asset documentation must demonstrate functionality and enable proper use.\n\nThis adaptation ensures publications are evaluated fairly within their intended purpose. While all publications must answer our core questions - what is this about, why does it matter, can I trust it, can I use it - the evidence needed to answer these questions appropriately varies by type.--DIVIDER--# 3. Publication Types\n\nPublications on Ready Tensor fall into four main categories based on their primary purpose and target audience:\n\n1. Research & Academic Publications - Present original research, methodology comparisons, and research explanations\n2. Educational Content - Teach concepts, techniques, and best practices\n3. Real-World Applications - Document industry solutions, case studies, and implementation guidance\n4. Technical Assets - Share datasets, code, and tools with the community--DIVIDER--The following chart lists the common project types:\n\n![publication-types.png](publication-types.png)\n--DIVIDER--\nThe following table describes each project type in detail, including the publication category, publication type, and a brief description along with examples:\n\n| Publication Category             | Publication Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Examples                                                                                                                                            |\n| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Research & Academic Publications | Research Paper                | Original research contributions presenting novel findings, methodologies, or analyses in AI/ML.

Pick Tool/App/Software\n:::--DIVIDER--# 4. Evaluation Criteria Structure\n\nThe evaluation rubric uses standardized criteria components to ensure consistent assessment. Each component serves a specific purpose in helping evaluators make objective decisions.\n\n## 4.1 Criteria Components\n\n**1. Criterion Name**\n\nA clear, descriptive title that identifies what aspect of the publication is being evaluated.\n\n**2. Criterion Description**\n\nThe description defines what the criterion measures and provides complete context for evaluation. It specifies where in the publication to look for evidence, clarifies what qualifies as meeting the criterion, and identifies any special cases or exceptions. A good criterion description removes ambiguity about what constitutes meeting the standard.\n\n**3. Scoring Logic**\n\nThe rubric uses binary scoring (0 or 1) with explicit rules stating what merits each score. This ensures evaluators have clear guidelines for assessment decisions. The scoring logic aims to remove subjectivity from the evaluation process by providing specific, measurable requirements.\n\n**4. Positive Indicators**\n\nPositive indicators are observable evidence in the publication that signal a criterion has been met. They provide concrete, verifiable signs that evaluators can look for during assessment. For example, if evaluating code quality, a positive indicator might be \"Code includes descriptive comments explaining each major function.\" These are specific elements that can be visually identified or objectively verified in the publication.\n\n**5. Negative Indicators**\n\nNegative indicators are observable evidence that a criterion has not been met. They represent specific, verifiable red flags that evaluators can spot during review. Following the code quality example, a negative indicator might be \"Functions lack parameter descriptions\" or \"No comments explaining complex logic.\" These indicators point to concrete, observable issues rather than subjective judgments.\n\n## 4.2 Purpose of Standardized Components\n\nThis structured approach promotes objective evaluation through clear rules and consistent assessment standards. When all evaluators use the same detailed criteria, they can arrive at similar scoring decisions independently. The components also provide actionable feedback - authors know exactly what they need to improve based on which criteria they did not meet.\n\nThe detailed criteria structure means publication creators can understand requirements before they begin writing. This helps them include necessary elements and avoid common problems that would reduce their evaluation scores.\n\nLet's examine how these components work together through an example...--DIVIDER--\n\n## 4.3 Example Criterion: Clear Purpose and Objectives\n\nThis fundamental criterion serves as a good example because it demonstrates how seemingly subjective requirements (\"clarity of purpose\") can be evaluated objectively through specific indicators.\n\n**Criterion Definition**\n\n```\nEvaluates whether the publication explicitly states its core purpose within the first\nparagraph or two. The purpose statement must clearly indicate what specific problem\nis being solved, what will be learned, or what will be demonstrated. This must appear\nin the abstract, tl;dr, introduction, or overview section and be immediately clear\nwithout requiring further reading.\n\nThe key differentiator is an explicit, specific purpose statement near the top that\nlets readers immediately understand what the publication will deliver.\n```\n\n**Scoring Logic**\n\n```\n- Score 0: Purpose is unclear, appears too late, requires inference, or is too vague\n- Score 1: Explicit purpose statement appears in first paragraph/10 sentences and clearly states specific deliverables\n```\n\n**Positive Indicators**\n\n```\nEvaluators look for these observable elements:\n\n- States specific purpose in first paragraph\n- Uses explicit purpose statement phrases (\"This paper demonstrates...\", \"In this guide, you will learn...\")\n- Lists specific skills or knowledge to be gained\n- States exact problem being solved\n- Defines precise scope of work\n- Indicates specific contributions or solutions\n- Provides clear list of deliverables\n```\n\n**Negative Indicators**\n\n```\nEvaluators watch for these red flags:\n\n- No purpose or objective stated\n- Purpose appears after several paragraphs\n- Requires reading multiple paragraphs to understand goal\n- Lists multiple potential purposes\n- Purpose scattered across document\n- Ambiguous or general statements\n- Purpose must be pieced together from multiple sections\n```\n\n**Why This Definition Works**\n\nNotice how this criterion converts the abstract concept of \"clear purpose\" into specific, verifiable elements:\n\n1. Location is objective - must appear in first paragraph\n2. Phrasing is verifiable - looks for specific statement types\n3. Content is measurable - checks for concrete deliverables\n4. Assessment is binary - either meets all requirements or does not\n\nThe indicators remove subjectivity by specifying exactly what evaluators should look for. Authors know precisely where to put their purpose statement and what it should contain.\n\n--DIVIDER--\n## 4.4  Complete List of Evaluation Criteria\n\nThe following table lists all technical criteria used in the evaluation rubric:\n![criteria-list.svg](criteria-list.svg)--DIVIDER--For detailed definitions of each criterion, including complete descriptions, scoring logic, and positive/negative indicators, refer to the supplementary document **Publication Evaluation Criteria Reference Guide.pdf** uploaded with this publication. Authors and evaluators should consult this reference when preparing or assessing publications.\n\n--DIVIDER--# 5. Publication Types and Evaluation Criteria\n\nThe evaluation rubric defines specific criteria for each publication type on Ready Tensor. These criteria ensure publications effectively serve their intended purpose and audience. By systematically answering core questions about purpose, significance, trustworthiness, and usability, authors can create high-quality publications that meet audience needs.\n\nThe complete mapping of criteria to publication types is provided in zipped package titled `Scoring Criteria Per Publication Type.zip` in the **Resources** section. While specific requirements vary, all criteria support answering the core questions in ways that match each publication type's purpose and audience expectations.\n--DIVIDER--:::caution{title=\"About the Evaluation Rubric\"}\nThe rubric provides a scoring mechanism where publications earn points by meeting different criteria. A higher score indicates stronger technical quality and completeness. Publications do not need to meet all criteria - the score reflects how many criteria are satisfied. For competitions, while scoring helps identify quality submissions, exceptional publications often provide unique insights, innovative approaches, or significant practical value beyond standard requirements.\n:::--DIVIDER--# 6. How the Scoring Mechanism Works\n\nThe evaluation rubric uses a straightforward scoring system based on objective criteria per publication type. The  evaluation follows these steps:\n\n1. **Publication Type**: Determine the specific type based on content and purpose (e.g., Research Paper, Tutorial, Dataset)\n\n2. **Applicable Criteria**: Apply the criteria set defined for that publication type\n\n3. **Binary Assessment**: Score each criterion:\n\n   - 1 point if criterion is met\n   - 0 points if criterion is not met\n\n4. **Equal Weighting**: Each criterion carries equal weight of one point\n\n5. **Total Score**: Sum the points across all applicable criteria\n\n6. **Final Assessment**: Compare total points to maximum possible score for that publication type. The score can be converted to a percentage for easier interpretation and simplistic comparison across different publications.\n\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Note on Scoring and Competition Evaluation\"}\nThis rubric adopts a simple approach where all criteria carry equal weight. Future versions may introduce weighted scoring to emphasize specific aspects like innovation or practical impact. While the rubric helps identify quality publications through objective criteria, competition winners are selected based on additional factors. A publication scoring 22/25 might win over one scoring 25/25 if it demonstrates exceptional innovation or practical value. The rubric serves as a baseline quality check rather than the sole determinant of competition outcomes.\n:::--DIVIDER--# 7. Example Publication Evaluation\n\nTo demonstrate how the evaluation rubric works in practice, let us examine a real publication: [Decade of AI and ML Conferences: A Comprehensive Dataset for Advanced Research and Analysis](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/iERF3DYAwsD9).\n\n\n\n## 7.1 Evaluation Criteria for the Publication\nThis publication falls under the \"Dataset Contribution\" type under the \"Technical Assets\" category. The evaluation rubric defines 29 specific criteria for this publication type, ensuring it meets the intended purpose and audience expectations. These are listed in the following figure.\n\n![Dataset Contribution Scoring Criteria.png](Dataset%20Contribution%20Scoring%20Criteria.png)\n\nThe technical content and resources provided by the authors are evaluated against these criteria to determine the publication's quality and effectiveness. The evaluation process involves systematically answering core questions about the publication's purpose, significance, trustworthiness, and usability.\n--DIVIDER--## 7.2 Evaluation Report \nWe have attached the evaluation report for this publication in the document titled \"Evaluation Report - Decade of AI and ML Conferences.pdf\" in the **Resources** section.

Cloud-based AI models are often unreliable due to **server downtime**, while company-provided interfaces lack flexibility, do not support multi-user interactions, and are frequently designed with **artificial limitations** to push users toward paid tiers. Additionally, some companies **intentionally degrade model performance** before releases for marketing purposes, creating an unnecessary cycle of artificial scarcity.\n\nTo address these issues, `tg-local-llm` provides a **fully independent, self-hosted AI assistant** that runs entirely on **local hardware**, ensuring maximum privacy and eliminating reliance on external providers. Built with a lightweight and easily modifiable stack using Deno and TypeScript, it allows users to customize and extend functionality with minimal programming experience\u2014or none at all. The bot integrates seamlessly into Telegram Messenger, making it a **handy, real-life companion for everyday tasks**. Unlike traditional AI UIs, this solution supports **long, continuous conversations, multi-user interactions, and a modular toolset** that allows for easy integration of additional capabilities.\n\nBy giving users full control over their AI assistant, tg-local-llm ensures **unrestricted access**, adaptability, and long-term reliability, making it an ideal choice for those who prioritize privacy, customization, and independence in their AI interactions.--DIVIDER--# Methodology\n\n## Under the hood\n- **System prompt** is divided into multiple sections\n\t- You: defines character, personality, and behavior.\n\t- Online Chat: defines environment of the conversation.\n\t- Tools: defines tool usage rules.\n\t\t- Provided Tools: a list of tools available to the model.\n\t- Messages Format: defines message structure and formatting rules.\n\t\t- User Messages: defines specifics of user (only) messages.\n\t\t- Your (assistant) Messages: defines specifics of model (only) messages.\n\t- Social Rules: defines list of rules to introduce social boundary bias and reduce censorship.\n- **Tools**\n\t- Web Search: model can search text and images on the web. This is a powerful and I think essential tool for any general purpose AI. There is no way other than web search to find realtime up to date information.\n\t- Get Text Contents: a supplement to web search, this tool allows the model to retrieve text contents from a specific URL. Required by web search to read urls after finding them, but can also be used to read specific URLs directly per user request.\n\n## Deep Dive\n- I use [LLama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to load LLM and run inference. Since llama.cpp server is OpenAI-compatible, you should be able to use tg-local-llm with any OpenAI-compatible API.\n- I use [grammY](https://grammy.dev/) framework to handle Telegram API.\n- I created basic controllers to handle incoming messages in groups, one for text/caption messages, and for per-chat preferences.\n- I created a simple API service to work with LLM API. Model and context length are set by a server, the service manages output structure, streaming and parsing.\n- At this point, with basic full-text match of a name in a message will allow model to respond. All messages are grouped by threads (a sequence of replies) and stored in a database for further context building. This essentially implements basic communication with a model and long conversations.\n- Next, I had to introduce tools, mainly for Web search. Sending tools along the message text (and potentially other pieces of data in a single message) is only possible with a strictly defined response format. This should be handled in two steps: first, I describe all so-called sections (such as message, tool, etc.) in System Prompt, with examples. This provides knowledge to a model about the structure of the response. This could work well, but sometimes model can misuse sections (write custom sections, use wrong characters, nest sections, etc.) so I leverage [Structured Outputs](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/grammars/README.md) by writing a strict grammar for the response format. Given this, model will technically be unable to break the format.\n- The tricky part, or \"\u03c3\u030c-solution\". Just running it as-is, model will almost never respond in a proper format. This is because grammar contains something similar to `<message_start> [any_character] <message_end>`. Given that grammars are not lazy, when model will generate `<message_end>` it will be treated as a part of `[any_character]`, so it won't be required to stop. Given the confusion between grammar requirement and model thinking that it already finished, it will always produce an insane amount of semi-random text. The simple solution is to pick some barely used character, such as `\u03c3\u030c`, and use it as a wrapper for section tags. Then, I replace `[any_character]` with `[any_character except \u03c3\u030c]`. This way, whenever the model is writing `\u03c3\u030c` it will be handled as a part of a required section tag since it can't belong to \"any character\" part. Later I changed it to `\u226a` (much less than) and `\u226b` (much greater than) to not to introduce another language in responses which can make model switch it for no reason.\n- Having implemented a reliable tool usage structure, I've built 2 tools: `search_web` and `read_article`. First one uses locally running [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) to retrieve a list of relevant links given `query`. As a response, model receives a bullet list of `source_url`, `title`. Second one uses headless browser to evaluate `document.body.innerText` essentially extracting all text from the web page. Result is passed to a separate LLM call (summarizer) with a request to summarize contents and remove metadata, summary is then given to main (chat context aware) model to respond. The tool is usually used after `search_web` or when users ask to read a specific URL. Bonus point: to avoid (rather minimise) robot checks and rejections on websites, I add custom User-Agent and some headers - it works much better (see `src/services/browser.ts`).\n- Given that, we have a few more possibilities. First, I added `category: text|image` to the `search_web` tool. This allows models to search images. Additional `image` section is used by model to provide a direct image URL which is then used by client. Also, I updated structure so that model will write `tool_call` section before the `message` section. Meaning, model can now describe what is it doing with tools and client can show this to user before it gets tool response and actual response from the model.\n- Simple thinking (reasoning) can now be easily implemented by adding a compulsory `thoughts` section before the `message` section. To make it meaningful, model is required to include `User Response`, `Reasoning`, and `Next Steps` sections within thoughts tag.\n- In addition, I add `tool_guide` section after `tool_response` with instructions on what to do with a specific tool response. For example, with text search, guide section will require model to select a source and use `get_text_content` tool read it. For image search, guide will prohibit extracting text and will require to provide one of the images in the response.\n- Sometimes it might be handy to introduce some permanent long-term memory notes. So I added basic memory instructions and a command `/ai remember` to add a note. Next step on this one and a great improvement could be to implement a simple `memory` tool so that model can read and write memory notes itself.\n- To provide a much nicer experience, I introduced per-chat preferences, such as NSFW roleplay, \"extreme state\" and message limit (context length) notes. These basically modify system prompt, adjusting model behavior. For instance, you can use `/ai extremely lazy` to make model behave like a lazy person: internally, it will inject an instruction to behave this way and disable some conflicting instructions. Given this, I recommend to generate system prompt every time rather than storing it as a message in the database.\n--DIVIDER--# Results\n### Model\n- Supports Reasoning\n- Supports Web Search (text and image)\n- Supports Web Page Reading (essential part of Web Search)\n- Supports multi-user conversations\n- Supports images (depends on LLM capabilities)\n- Responds before/along with tool usage\n- Minimal censorship\n- Human-like character\n- Bullet-proof message structure handling\n\n### UI\n- Answers any text/caption messages in group chats when mentioned by name\n- Supports long conversations via replies\n- Supports quote replies\n- Supports TL;DR, analysis, etc. requests by replies\n- Ignores messages starting with `//` for hidden replies\n- Supports continuous typing (edits message with more text)\n- Various preferences\n\n# Notes\n- Simple `Containerfile` was added for containerization.

As data scientists and machine learning engineers, have you ever revisited your old code and struggled to understand what it does? Or maybe a colleague needed to work with your code, and you had to spend time explaining it to them? This is where the use of docstrings in Python comes into play.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will explore three popular styles of docstrings: Google-style, Numpy-style, and reStructuredText. The goal isn't to use all three, but to understand their differences, strengths, and nuances so that you can choose the style that best suits your projects and way of working.\n\nHere's a brief outline of what we'll cover:\n\n- **Introduction to Docstrings**: We'll start by discussing what docstrings are and how they can be used in Python to document your code effectively.\n- **Why Docstrings Matter in Machine Learning Projects**: After understanding their importance, we'll discuss why something seemingly trivial as docstrings can have a significant impact on the productivity of a data science team.\n- **Exploring Docstring Styles**: We will delve into the three primary docstring styles - Google, Numpy, and reStructuredText. Each has its own structure, format, and use cases which we will cover in detail.\n- **Choosing the Right Docstring Style for Your Project**: In this section, we'll discuss considerations for choosing the appropriate docstring style for your needs. This will include factors such as the nature of the project, the team's familiarity with the style, and the tools used for documentation generation.\n- **Best Practices for Writing and Maintaining Docstrings**: Lastly, we will share some practical tips and best practices for writing clear, useful, and maintainable docstrings in your machine learning projects.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you'll have a good understanding of the different docstring styles and be able to select and implement the one that best aligns with your machine learning project's needs. Let's boost our code documentation practices together!\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# Introduction to Docstrings\n\nBefore we delve into the importance of docstrings in machine learning projects, let's first understand what docstrings are.\n\nIn Python, a docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Enclosed by triple quotes (either ''' or \"\"\"), docstrings provide a convenient way to associate documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods.\n\nConsider the following example of a function that scales a numpy array, which is a common operation in data preprocessing in machine learning:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef scale_array(array: np.ndarray, factor: float) -> np.ndarray:\n    \"\"\"\n    This function scales a numpy array by a given factor.\n\n    Args:\n        array (np.ndarray): The numpy array to be scaled.\n        factor (float): The scale factor.\n\n    Returns:\n        np.ndarray: The scaled numpy array.\n    \"\"\"\n    return array * factor\n```\n\nIn the above example, the docstring provides a brief explanation of what the function does, its parameters (`Args`), and what it returns (`Returns`). The type hints in the function definition provide additional context about the expected types of the arguments and the return type. This combination makes it easier for anyone reading the code to understand the function's purpose without having to analyze its implementation.\n\nNow that we have introduced what docstrings are and seen an example of their use in a function relevant to data science, let's move on to understand their importance in machine learning projects.\n--DIVIDER--# Why Docstrings Matter in Machine Learning Projects\n\nMachine Learning projects, by nature, are often complex and multifaceted. They involve intricate algorithms, sophisticated models, and layers of data preprocessing steps. This complexity is exacerbated when multiple team members are involved, each bringing their unique approach to the codebase.\n\nIn this setting, code comprehension and knowledge transfer become crucial. This is where docstrings, and code documentation in general, play a vital role.\n\nHere's why docstrings matter:\n\n1. **Improved Code Readability**: Docstrings provide a concise summary of what a piece of code or a function does. They guide the reader through the logic of the code without them having to dissect every line.\n\n2. **Enhanced Team Efficiency**: Well-documented code is a blessing when working in teams. It allows others to understand and use your functions correctly, reducing the need for lengthy explanations. It also helps onboard new team members quicker, as they can navigate the codebase more easily.\n\n3. **Easier Code Maintenance and Debugging**: Good docstrings make it much easier to revisit your code for maintenance, debugging, or updates. They serve as reminders of what you intended the function to do, making it easier to identify and fix issues.\n\n4. **Useful for Auto-Generated Documentation**: Docstrings serve as the foundation for auto-generated documentation using tools like Sphinx or Doxygen. If you decide to create API documentation or a manual for your project, consistent and comprehensive docstrings can make this process smooth and efficient.\n\n5. **Professionalism and Best Practices**: Taking the time to write good docstrings reflects on your commitment to code quality and best practices. It's a professional habit that distinguishes seasoned developers from novices.\n\n6. **Contributions to Open Source Projects**: When contributing to open source projects, good docstrings are crucial. They ensure that your contributions can be understood and utilized by others in the community. Good documentation increases the chances of your contributions being accepted and valued by the community.\n\nWe understand that writing docstrings can sometimes feel like a burden, especially when you're in the flow of coding. However, investing a little time in writing clear, concise docstrings can save you and your team much more time in the future.\n\nIn the following sections, we will introduce you to three different docstring styles, helping you pick a style that best suits your needs and gets you into the habit of writing valuable docstrings.--DIVIDER--# Exploring Docstring Styles\n\nWhen it comes to writing docstrings in Python, there are several established styles that developers use. While the choice of style often comes down to personal preference or team conventions, certain styles offer specific advantages that may be more suited to your project's needs. In this tutorial, we will cover three of the most popular docstring styles in use today: Google, Numpy, and reStructuredText.--DIVIDER--**Example Overview for Docstring Demonstrations**  \n\nBefore we get into the three styles of docstrings, let's consider an example that we'll use to demonstrate each style. This example will be a simple module that contains a class and a function. Please note that we'll be using this example strictly for docstring demonstration and won't actually be showing the implementations for these functions or classes. Here are the details:\n\n**Module: `linear_models.py`**  \n\nOur module, named `linear_models.py`, provides methods and classes related to simple linear regression, a foundational concept in data science and statistics. The module allows users to perform basic linear regression tasks, including fitting a model to data and evaluating its performance.\n\n**Class: `SimpleLinearRegression`**  \n\nWithin the `linear_models.py` module, we have the `SimpleLinearRegression` class. This class allows users to perform simple linear regression. When given training data, the class computes the slope and intercept of the best-fit line using the least squares method. The primary methods of this class are:\n\n- `fit(x_train, y_train)`: Fits the training data and computes the slope and intercept.\n- `predict(x_test)`: Given test data, predicts the y-values based on the previously computed slope and intercept.\n\n**Function: `calculate_r_squared(y_true, y_pred)`**  \n\nThe `calculate_r_squared` function is a utility within our module. It takes in the true y-values of the data and the predicted y-values from a regression model. The function then computes the R-squared value, a metric that quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that's predictable from the independent variable(s). A higher R-squared value indicates a model that explains more of the variance, making it a useful evaluation metric for regression tasks.\n\nLet's now proceed to explore the three docstring styles in detail.--DIVIDER--## Google Style Docstrings\n\nGoogle style docstrings are arguably one of the most user-friendly and readable formats. They are clear, concise, and organized, which makes them a great choice for both small and large scale projects.\n\nTo showcase the Google style, we'll provide examples of docstrings for our data science-centric module, class, and function, which focus on linear regression modeling. Let's begin with the module:\n\n**Module: `linear_models.py`**  \n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThis module provides methods and classes related to simple linear regression.\n\nIt allows users to perform basic linear regression tasks, such as fitting a\nmodel to data and evaluating its performance.\n\nExample:\n    >>> from linear_models import SimpleLinearRegression, calculate_r_squared\n    >>> model = SimpleLinearRegression()\n    >>> x_train, y_train = [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3.1]\n    >>> model.fit(x_train, y_train)\n    >>> y_pred = model.predict([4, 5])\n    >>> r_squared = calculate_r_squared(y_train, model.predict(x_train))\n    >>> print(r_squared)\n    0.999  # hypothetical output\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Class: `SimpleLinearRegression`**  \n\n```python\nclass SimpleLinearRegression:\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs simple linear regression.\n\n    This class computes the slope and intercept of the best-fit line using\n    the least squares method.\n\n    Attributes:\n        slope (float): Slope of the regression line.\n        intercept (float): Y-intercept of the regression line.\n\n    Methods:\n        fit(x_train, y_train): Fits the training data.\n        predict(x_test): Predicts y-values for given x-values.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> model = SimpleLinearRegression()\n        >>> x_train, y_train = [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3.1]\n        >>> model.fit(x_train, y_train)\n        >>> model.predict([4, 5])\n        [4.03, 5.03]  # hypothetical output\n    \"\"\"\n    slope: float\n    intercept: float\n\n    def fit(self, x_train: List[float], y_train: List[float]) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Fits the training data and computes the slope and intercept.\n\n        Args:\n            x_train (List[float]): Training data for independent variable.\n            y_train (List[float]): Training data for dependent variable.\n\n        Note:\n            This method computes the coefficients using the least squares method.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Code for fitting...\n\n    def predict(self, x_test: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Predicts y-values based on the previously computed slope and intercept.\n\n        Args:\n            x_test (List[float]): Data for which predictions are to be made.\n\n        Returns:\n            List[float]: Predicted y-values.\n\n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If the model is not yet fitted (i.e., slope and intercept are not computed).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Code for predicting...\n```\n\n**Function: `calculate_r_squared(y_true, y_pred)`**  \n\n```python\ndef calculate_r_squared(y_true: List[float], y_pred: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the R-squared value.\n\n    Args:\n        y_true (List[float]): True y-values.\n        y_pred (List[float]): Predicted y-values from the regression model.\n\n    Returns:\n        float: The R-squared value.\n\n    Example:\n        >>> y_true = [1, 2, 3]\n        >>> y_pred = [0.9, 2.1, 2.9]\n        >>> calculate_r_squared(y_true, y_pred)\n        0.989  # hypothetical output\n\n    Note:\n        R-squared quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable\n        that's predictable from the independent variables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Code for calculating R-squared ...\n```\n\nIn this Google style docstring:\n\n- The `Args` and `Returns` sections describe function or method arguments and return values.\n- The `Raises` section indicates exceptions that the function or method may raise under certain conditions.\n- We use an `Example` section in both the module and class docstrings to show simple usage.\n- The `Note` inline comment provides additional details or considerations about the function or method.\n\nThis style allows for clean separation between sections, which can enhance readability.--DIVIDER--## Numpy Style Docstrings\n\nNumpy style docstrings have gained immense popularity within the Python scientific computing community, in large part due to the influence of the Numpy library itself. This style is particularly appealing for projects that involve mathematical operations or when mathematical notation is frequent. It provides clear demarcation between sections with underlines, making it visually distinct and easy to navigate.\n\nFor a clearer understanding, let's look at our previously discussed module, class, and function, this time documented in the Numpy style:\n\n**Module: `linear_models.py`**  \n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nlinear_models\n-------------\n\nThis module provides methods and classes related to simple linear regression.\n\nIt allows users to perform basic linear regression tasks, such as fitting a\nmodel to data and evaluating its performance.\n\nExamples\n--------\n>>> from linear_models import SimpleLinearRegression, calculate_r_squared\n>>> model = SimpleLinearRegression()\n>>> x_train, y_train = [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3.1]\n>>> model.fit(x_train, y_train)\n>>> y_pred = model.predict([4, 5])\n>>> r_squared = calculate_r_squared(y_train, model.predict(x_train))\n>>> print(r_squared)\n0.999  # hypothetical output\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Class: `SimpleLinearRegression`**  \n\n```python\nclass SimpleLinearRegression:\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs simple linear regression.\n\n    This class computes the slope and intercept of the best-fit line using\n    the least squares method.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    slope : float\n        Slope of the regression line.\n    intercept : float\n        Y-intercept of the regression line.\n\n    Methods\n    -------\n    fit(x_train, y_train)\n        Fits the training data.\n    predict(x_test)\n        Predicts y-values for given x-values.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> model = SimpleLinearRegression()\n    >>> x_train, y_train = [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3.1]\n    >>> model.fit(x_train, y_train)\n    >>> model.predict([4, 5])\n    [4.03, 5.03]  # hypothetical output\n    \"\"\"\n    slope: float\n    intercept: float\n\n    def fit(self, x_train: List[float], y_train: List[float]) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Fits the training data and computes the slope and intercept.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        x_train : list of float\n            Training data for independent variable.\n        y_train : list of float\n            Training data for dependent variable.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        This method computes the coefficients using the least squares method.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Code for fitting...\n\n    def predict(self, x_test: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Predicts y-values based on the previously computed slope and intercept.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        x_test : list of float\n            Data for which predictions are to be made.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        list of float\n            Predicted y-values.\n\n        Raises\n        ------\n        ValueError\n            If the model is not yet fitted (i.e., slope and intercept are not computed).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Code for predicting...\n```\n\n**Function: `calculate_r_squared`**  \n\n```python\ndef calculate_r_squared(y_true: List[float], y_pred: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the R-squared value.\n\n    R-squared quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable\n    that's predictable from the independent variables.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    y_true : List[float]\n        True y-values.\n    y_pred : List[float]\n        Predicted y-values from the regression model.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    float\n        The R-squared value.\n\n    Examples\n    --------\n    >>> y_true = [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> y_pred = [0.9, 2.1, 2.9]\n    >>> calculate_r_squared(y_true, y_pred)\n    0.989 # hypothetical output\n    \"\"\"\n    # Code for calculating R-squared ...\n```\n\nWith Numpy style docstrings, each section (e.g., Parameters, Returns, Raises, and Examples) is distinctly separated, making it easy to locate and understand specific details. Parameters and Returns sections are verbose, ensuring clarity, and the style's ability to include notes, warnings, and usage examples further enriches the documentation.--DIVIDER--## reStructuredText Style Docstrings\n\nreStructuredText (reST) style docstrings provide a formalized way to write documentation. This format is especially powerful due to its ability to support rich text markup, allowing for easy generation of HTML or PDF documentation using tools like Sphinx.\n\n**Module: `linear_models.py`**  \n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThis module provides methods and classes related to simple linear regression.\n\nIt allows users to perform basic linear regression tasks, such as fitting a\nmodel to data and evaluating its performance.\n\n.. example::\n\n    >>> from linear_models import SimpleLinearRegression, calculate_r_squared\n    >>> model = SimpleLinearRegression()\n    >>> x_train, y_train = [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3.1]\n    >>> model.fit(x_train, y_train)\n    >>> y_pred = model.predict([4, 5])\n    >>> r_squared = calculate_r_squared(y_train, model.predict(x_train))\n    >>> print(r_squared)\n    0.999  # hypothetical output\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n**Class: `SimpleLinearRegression`**  \n\n```python\nclass SimpleLinearRegression:\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs simple linear regression.\n\n    This class computes the slope and intercept of the best-fit line using\n    the least squares method.\n\n    :ivar slope: Slope of the regression line.\n    :ivar intercept: Y-intercept of the regression line.\n\n    :methods: fit(x_train, y_train), predict(x_test)\n\n    .. example::\n\n        >>> model = SimpleLinearRegression()\n        >>> x_train, y_train = [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3.1]\n        >>> model.fit(x_train, y_train)\n        >>> model.predict([4, 5])\n        [4.03, 5.03]  # hypothetical output\n    \"\"\"\n    slope: float\n    intercept: float\n\n    def fit(self, x_train: List[float], y_train: List[float]) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Fits the training data and computes the slope and intercept.\n\n        :param x_train: Training data for independent variable.\n        :type x_train: List[float]\n        :param y_train: Training data for dependent variable.\n        :type y_train: List[float]\n\n        .. note::\n            This method computes the coefficients using the least squares method.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Code for fitting...\n\n    def predict(self, x_test: List[float]) -> List[float]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Predicts y-values based on the previously computed slope and intercept.\n\n        :param x_test: Data for which predictions are to be made.\n        :type x_test: List[float]\n        :return: Predicted y-values.\n        :rtype: List[float]\n        :raises ValueError: If the model is not yet fitted (i.e., slope and intercept are not computed).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Code for predicting...\n```\n\n**Function: `calculate_r_squared`**  \n\n```python\ndef calculate_r_squared(y_true: List[float], y_pred: List[float]) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the R-squared value.\n\n    :param y_true: True y-values.\n    :type y_true: List[float]\n    :param y_pred: Predicted y-values from the regression model.\n    :type y_pred: List[float]\n    :return: The R-squared value.\n    :rtype: float\n\n    .. example::\n\n        >>> y_true = [1, 2, 3]\n        >>> y_pred = [0.9, 2.1, 2.9]\n        >>> calculate_r_squared(y_true, y_pred)\n        0.989  # hypothetical output\n\n    .. note::\n        R-squared quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable\n        that's predictable from the independent variables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Code for calculating R-squared ...\n```\n\nAs you can observe, reStructuredText uses colons (`:`) for argument and return type specifications. The `.. note::`, `.. example::`, and other directives add richness to the docstrings, making them more comprehensive and user-friendly.--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n**Integrating reStructuredText with Sphinx**  \nWhile reStructuredText is a markup language in its own right, its relevance to Python developers is often closely tied to the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) documentation generator. Sphinx utilizes reStructuredText to produce rich, navigable documentation for software projects. By following a consistent style in your docstrings and combining it with Sphinx, you can easily generate professional-quality documentation for your projects. If you're considering producing detailed documentation for larger projects, integrating reStructuredText with Sphinx is highly recommended.\n:::--DIVIDER--# Choosing the Right Docstring Style for Your Project\n\nWhen it comes to docstring styles, there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. The best style for your project depends on several factors, including the complexity of your project, your team's preferences, and the tools you're using.\n\n**Google Style**: If your team prefers a style that is simple to write and easy to read, the Google style might be the best choice. It is concise, human-readable, and doesn't require you to learn a new markup language. This style is a great choice for smaller projects or projects where the primary audience is the code's users rather than developers.\n\n**NumPy Style**: If your project involves complex data types or mathematical operations, the NumPy style might be more appropriate. This style excels in projects that require precise, detailed explanations for parameters and return types\u2014something often necessary in data science and machine learning projects. NumPy-style docstrings can be a bit verbose, but they can significantly improve the clarity of your code.\n\n**reStructuredText Style**: If your project involves generating documentation using Sphinx, the reStructuredText style is the best choice. It supports a variety of additional directives, making it the most flexible option for creating rich, structured documentation.\n\nRemember, the main purpose of docstrings is to provide clear, understandable explanations for your code's functionality. The best docstring style for you is the one that helps you achieve this goal most effectively. While it's good practice to maintain consistency in your project, don't hesitate to switch styles if a different one better suits your needs.\n\nRegardless of the style you choose, the use of docstrings will undoubtedly make your code more understandable, maintainable, and reusable, thereby increasing the overall quality of your machine learning project.--DIVIDER--# Best Practices for Writing and Maintaining Docstrings\n\nMaintaining high-quality docstrings is an ongoing process. Here are some best practices that can help ensure your docstrings are as helpful as possible:\n\n1. **Write Comprehensive Docstrings**: A docstring should describe what a function does, its input parameters, its return values, and any exceptions it raises. If applicable, it should also include a brief example of usage. A well-written docstring allows others (and future you!) to understand your code without having to read and understand all of its source code.\n\n2. **Keep Your Docstrings Up to Date**: As your code changes, make sure your docstrings are updated to reflect those changes. Outdated or incorrect documentation can be even more confusing than no documentation at all.\n\n3. **Be Concise but Clear**: While docstrings should be detailed, they shouldn't be excessively verbose. Aim to make your docstrings as concise as possible without sacrificing clarity.\n\n4. **Use Third Person Point of View**: Write your docstrings as if you're describing the function to another person. For example, instead of \"We calculate the mean\", write \"This function calculates the mean\".\n\n5. **Maintain Consistency**: Within a project, try to maintain a consistent style of docstrings. This makes it easier for others to understand your codebase.\n\n6. **Avoid Mentioning Redundant Details**: If a detail is obvious from the source code, there's no need to include it in the docstring. For instance, if a function named `add_numbers` takes two arguments `num1` and `num2`, you don't need to mention in the docstring that the function adds numbers\u2014it's self-explanatory.\n\n7. **Use Type Hints**: Type hints complement docstrings by providing explicit indications of a function's input and output types. This can make your code even more understandable.\n\nIncorporating these practices will enhance the effectiveness of your docstrings, making your code much easier to understand and maintain\u2014crucial aspects in machine learning projects, especially when they grow in size or when you're collaborating with others.--DIVIDER--# Summary\n\nThis tutorial offers a deep dive into three primary docstring styles prevalent in Python: Google, Numpy, and reStructuredText. Tailored for data scientists and machine learning engineers, the guide highlights the importance of thorough documentation, especially in complex data-driven projects. With clear examples, including type hints and in-doc examples, practitioners are equipped to write clear, concise, and informative docstrings, ensuring that ML models and data processing functions are understandable and maintainable by teams and future contributors.--DIVIDER--# References\n\n1.

Let's get started!\n--DIVIDER--# Introduction to PEP8\n\nPython, as a programming language, has gained widespread popularity among data scientists and machine learning engineers due to its simplicity and readability. PEP8, the official style guide for Python code, plays a significant role in maintaining this readability by providing a set of conventions that developers can follow when writing Python code. Adhering to these conventions ensures that the code is consistent, clean, and easy to understand, making it more maintainable and accessible for collaboration.\n\nPEP8 is particularly important for data scientists and ML engineers working in teams, as it helps create a standardized codebase that is easier for all team members to read and understand. A consistent coding style enables efficient collaboration, smooth communication, and reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings and errors, which are essential factors in delivering high-quality projects. PEP8 also helps developers avoid common pitfalls and mistakes, such as using ambiguous variable names or inconsistent indentation, which can lead to bugs and make code difficult to maintain.\nLet us now dive into the PEP8 style guide and explore its key recommendations for writing clean, professional Python code.\n--DIVIDER--# Key PEP8 recommendations\n\nIn this section, we will explore the key recommendations of the PEP8 style guide, which covers various aspects of Python code, including naming conventions, indentation, line length, whitespace, and more.--DIVIDER--## Naming conventions\n\nThe following are the key recommendations for naming conventions in Python code:\n\n- **Variable names**: Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in variable names. For example, `num_samples`, `learning_rate`, `model_name`, etc.\n- **Function names**: Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in function names. For example, `train_model`, `evaluate_model`, `get_data`, etc.\n- **Class names**: Use CamelCase to separate words in class names. For example, `DataLoader`, `Model`, `Trainer`, etc.\n- **Constants**: Use all uppercase letters and underscores to separate words in constant names. For example, `NUM_SAMPLES`, `LEARNING_RATE`, `MODEL_NAME`, etc.\n- **Private variables**: Use a single underscore prefix to indicate private variables. For example, `_num_samples`, `_learning_rate`, `_model_name`, etc.\n- **Private functions**: Use a single underscore prefix to indicate private functions. For example, `_train_model`, `_evaluate_model`, `_get_data`, etc.\n- **modules**: Use short, all-lowercase names for modules. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. `data_loader.py`, `model.py`, `trainer.py`, etc.\n- **packages**: Use short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged. For example, `dataloader`, `model`, `trainer`, etc.\n- **exceptions**: Use CamelCase for exception names. For example, `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.\n- **arguments**: Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in argument names. For example, `num_samples`, `learning_rate`, `model_name`, etc.\n- **keyword arguments**: Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in keyword argument names. For example, `num_samples`, `learning_rate`, `model_name`, etc.--DIVIDER--## Indentation\n\nPEP8 style guide recommends the following for indentation in Python code:\n\n- Use 4 spaces per indentation level, not tabs\n- Align continuation lines with the opening delimiter, or use a hanging indent with 4-space indentation\n\nThe following is an example of correct indentation:\n\n```python\n# Correct:\n\n# Aligned with opening delimiter.\nfoo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,\n                         var_three, var_four)\n\n# Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.\ndef long_function_name(\n        var_one, var_two, var_three,\n        var_four):\n    print(var_one)\n\n# Hanging indents should add a level.\nfoo = long_function_name(\n    var_one, var_two,\n    var_three, var_four)\n```\n\nThe following is an example of wrong indentation:\n\n```python\n# Wrong:\n\n# Arguments on first line forbidden when not using vertical alignment.\nfoo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,\n    var_three, var_four)\n\n# Further indentation required as indentation is not distinguishable.\ndef long_function_name(\n    var_one, var_two, var_three,\n    var_four):\n    print(var_one)\n```--DIVIDER--## Line length\n\nAccording to PEP8, the recommended maximum line length for Python code is 79 characters, including whitespace. This limit is designed to improve code readability by preventing lines from becoming excessively long and difficult to follow. Additionally, it ensures that the code can be easily viewed on various devices and screens without horizontal scrolling.\n\nWhen a statement is too long to fit within the 79-character limit, you can break it into multiple lines using parentheses, brackets, or braces, or by using the line continuation character (''). Make sure to follow the indentation guidelines discussed earlier for continuation lines.\n\nFor comments and docstrings, PEP8 recommends a slightly shorter maximum line length of 72 characters. This allows for proper formatting when generating documentation or displaying the comments and docstrings in various contexts.\n--DIVIDER--## Whitespace\n\nAppropriate use of whitespace is vital for code readability, as it visually separates different elements and helps to convey the structure of the code. PEP8 provides several recommendations for using whitespace in Python code. Let us explore them in detail:\n\n#### Blank lines\n\nBlank lines play an essential role in visually separating different sections of code, making it easier to understand the code's structure and organization.\n\n- Top-level functions and class definitions:\n\nUse two blank lines to separate top-level functions and class definitions. This practice helps to distinguish between different sections of your code and improves overall readability.\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    # Class implementation\n\n\ndef my_function():\n    # Function implementation\n\n\nclass AnotherClass:\n    # Class implementation\n```\n\n- Method definitions inside a class:\n\nUse one blank line to separate method definitions inside a class. This spacing helps to delineate the individual methods and their boundaries within the class.\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n\n    def method_one(self):\n        # Method implementation\n\n    def method_two(self):\n        # Method implementation\n\n    def method_three(self):\n        # Method implementation\n```\n\n- Grouping related sections of code:\n\nYou can use blank lines to group related sections of code within a function or method. However, it is essential not to overuse blank lines, as too many can make your code appear disjointed and less coherent.\n\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    # Section 1: Data preprocessing\n    # ...\n\n    # Section 2: Model training\n    # ...\n\n    # Section 3: Model evaluation\n    # ...\n```\n\n#### White space in expressions and statements\n\n- Use spaces around operators and after commas to improve readability. For example:\n\n```python\nresult = a + b * (c - d)\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n- Do not use spaces around the \"=\" sign when used for keyword arguments or default parameter values:\n\n```python\ndef my_function(a, b, c=None, d=0):\n    pass\n```\n\n- Place a single space before and after assignment operators, comparison operators, and boolean operators:\n\n```python\nx = 5\ny = x * 2\nif x > 0 and y < 10:\n    print(\"Within range\")\n```\n\n- Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:\n\n  - Immediately inside parentheses, brackets, or braces:\n\n    ```python\n    # Correct\n    my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n\n    # Incorrect\n    my_list = [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n    ```\n\n  - Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon:\n\n    ```python\n    # Correct\n    my_dict = {\"key\": \"value\", \"another_key\": \"another_value\"}\n\n    # Incorrect\n    my_dict = {\"key\" : \"value\" , \"another_key\" : \"another_value\"}\n    ```\n\n  - Immediately before the open parenthesis that starts the argument list of a function call:\n\n    ```python\n    # Correct\n    result = my_function(arg1, arg2)\n\n    # Incorrect\n    result = my_function (arg1, arg2)\n    ```\n\n  - Immediately before the open bracket that starts an indexing or slicing operation:\n\n    ```python\n    # Correct\n    my_value = my_list[3]\n\n    # Incorrect\n    my_value = my_list [3]\n    ``--DIVIDER--## Imports\n\nThe following are the key recommendations for imports in Python code:\n\nImports:\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the PEP8 recommendations regarding the organization and style of import statements in Python code. Properly organizing imports improves the code's readability and makes it easier to identify dependencies.\n\n#### Order of imports\n\nPEP8 recommends organizing imports into three distinct groups, separated by a blank line. The groups are as follows:\n\n1. Standard library imports\n2. Third-party library imports\n3. Local application or library imports\n\nThis organization helps to visually separate different types of imports and makes it clear where each imported module or package originates.\n\n```python\n# Standard library imports\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# Third-party library imports\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Local application/library imports\nimport my_module\nimport another_module\n```\n\n#### Import style\n\nPEP8 recommends using absolute imports rather than relative imports, as they are usually more readable and less prone to errors. Additionally, it is recommended to use the \"import\" statement to import an entire module or specific objects from a module, instead of using \"from ... import \\*\", which can lead to unclear or conflicting names in the namespace.\n\n```python\n# Recommended\nimport my_module\nfrom my_module import my_function\n\n# Not recommended\nfrom my_module import *\n```\n\n#### Line length and multiple imports:\n\nWhen importing multiple objects from a single module, and the line length exceeds the recommended 79 characters, you can break the imports into multiple lines using parentheses and place one import per line.\n\n```python\nfrom my_module import (\n    first_function,\n    second_function,\n    third_function,\n)\n```\n\n#### Alphabetical order:\n\nTo further improve the readability of your import statements, you can order them alphabetically within each import group. This practice makes it easier to locate specific imports when scanning the code.\n\n```python\n# Standard library imports\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n# Third-party library imports\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Local application/library imports\nimport my_module\nimport another_module\n```--DIVIDER--## Docstrings and Comments\n\nLet's review the PEP8 recommendations for docstrings and comments in Python code.\n\n#### Docstrings\n\nDocstrings are multi-line strings used to provide documentation for modules, classes, functions, and methods. They are enclosed in triple quotes (either single or double) and should be placed immediately after the definition of the entity they document.\n\nPEP8 recommends following the \"docstring conventions\" laid out in PEP 257. Some key points from PEP 257 include:\n\n- For a one-line docstring, keep the summary concise and on the same line as the opening triple quotes, followed by the closing triple quotes.\n\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    \"\"\"This is a concise one-line docstring.\"\"\"\n    # Function implementation\n```\n\n- For a multi-line docstring, start with a one-line summary, followed by a blank line, and then a more detailed description. The closing triple quotes should be placed on a new line.\n\n```python\ndef my_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a summary of the function's purpose.\n\n    This section provides a more detailed description of the function, its\n    arguments, return values, and any exceptions it may raise. The description\n    can span multiple lines, adhering to the recommended 72-character limit\n    for docstrings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Function implementation\n```\n\n#### Comments\n\nComments are an essential tool for explaining the purpose, logic, or implementation details of your code. PEP8 provides several recommendations for writing and formatting comments to maximize their usefulness and readability:\n\n- Use inline comments sparingly and ensure they are separated by at least two spaces from the code statement. Start the comment with a '#' followed by a single space.\n\n```python\nx = x + 1  # Increment the value of x\n```\n\n- Keep comments up-to-date, as outdated comments can be more confusing than helpful.\n\n- Use complete sentences when writing comments, and ensure they are clear, concise, and relevant to the code they describe.\n\n- For block comments, which describe a section of code, place them before the code they describe and align them with the code. Start each line with a '#' followed by a single space.\n\n```python\n# The following section of code calculates the sum\n# of all elements in the list and stores the result\n# in the variable 'total_sum'\ntotal_sum = 0\nfor element in my_list:\n    total_sum += element\n```\n--DIVIDER--# Linters and Formatters to Enforce PEP8\n\nLinters and formatters are useful to check and enforce PEP8 compliance in your Python code. Linters analyze your code for potential errors, bugs, and non-compliant coding practices, while formatters automatically adjust your code's formatting to adhere to PEP8 guidelines.--DIVIDER--### Linters\n\nThere are several popular linters available for checking PEP8 compliance in Python code. Two widely-used linters are:\n\n- Flake8: Flake8 is a popular linter that combines the functionality of PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe complexity checking. It is easy to configure and can be integrated with various text editors and IDEs. To install and use Flake8, run the following commands:\n\n```\npip install flake8\nflake8 your_script.py\n```\n\n- Pylint: Pylint is another powerful linter that goes beyond PEP8 compliance checks and provides additional insights into code quality, potential bugs, and refactoring opportunities. To install and use Pylint, run the following commands:\n\n```\npip install pylint\npylint your_script.py\n```\n\nBoth linters can be customized to fit your team's preferences and project requirements by modifying their configuration files.--DIVIDER--### Formatters\n\nFormatters are tools that automatically adjust your code's formatting to adhere to PEP8 guidelines. Two popular formatters are:\n\n- Black: Black is an opinionated code formatter that prioritizes consistency and readability. With minimal configuration options, Black enforces a uniform coding style across your project. To install and use Black, run the following commands:\n\n```\npip install black\nblack your_script.py\n```\n\n- Autopep8: Autopep8 is a formatter that focuses specifically on PEP8 compliance. It provides more configuration options than Black, allowing for greater customization. To install and use Autopep8, run the following commands:\n\n```\npip install autopep8\nautopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive your_script.py\n```\n\nBy using linters and formatters, you can ensure that your Python code adheres to PEP8 guidelines, improving its readability and maintainability. In the upcoming sections, we will discuss integrating PEP8 checks into your development workflow and continuous integration (CI) pipeline, which will help you maintain a consistent coding style throughout your project.\n--DIVIDER--# Integrating PEP8 Checks into Development Workflow\n\nIn this section, we will discuss how to integrate PEP8 checks into your development workflow to maintain a consistent coding style and catch issues early in the development process. Integrating PEP8 checks into your workflow will help you and your team ensure that your Python code remains readable and maintainable.\n--DIVIDER--### Text editor and IDE integrations\n\nMany text editors and IDEs support PEP8 compliance checking, either natively or through plugins. Integrating PEP8 checks into your preferred text editor or IDE allows you to see and fix issues as you write code. Some popular text editors and IDEs with PEP8 support include:\n\n- Visual Studio Code: You can use extensions like \"Python\" by Microsoft or \"Pylance\" to enable PEP8 checking and formatting.\n- PyCharm: PyCharm has built-in PEP8 compliance checking and automatic formatting support.\n- Sublime Text: Install the \"SublimeLinter\" and \"SublimeLinter-flake8\" packages to enable PEP8 checking.\n\n#### Pre-commit hooks\n\nPre-commit hooks are scripts that run automatically before each commit, allowing you to check for PEP8 compliance and other issues before your changes are committed to the repository. You can use the \"pre-commit\" framework to manage pre-commit hooks for PEP8 compliance checking and automatic formatting. To set up pre-commit hooks, follow these steps:\n\n- Install the pre-commit package:\n\n```\npip install pre-commit\n```\n\n- Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your project's root directory with the following content:\n\n```yaml\nrepos:\n  - repo: https://github.com/ambv/black\n    rev: stable\n    hooks:\n      - id: black\n        language_version: python3.7\n  - repo: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8\n    rev: 3.9.2\n    hooks:\n      - id: flake8\n```\n\n- Run `pre-commit install` to set up the pre-commit hooks.\n\nNow, every time you commit changes to your repository, the pre-commit hooks will check for PEP8 compliance and format your code automatically.\n\n#### Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline\n\nIntegrating PEP8 checks into your CI pipeline ensures that any code changes submitted by you or your team members meet the required coding standards before they are merged into the main branch. Popular CI services like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and Jenkins can be configured to run PEP8 checks on each pull request or merge request. This setup will help you maintain consistent code quality across your project.\n\nBy integrating PEP8 checks into your development workflow, you can ensure that your Python code remains readable, maintainable, and adheres to a consistent coding style. This practice will help you and your team catch issues early, streamline collaboration, and improve the overall quality of your project.--DIVIDER--# Customizing PEP8 to Fit Team and Project Needs\n\nIn real-world projects, it's often necessary to adapt PEP8 rules to meet the specific needs of your team and project. By customizing the configuration of linters and formatters, you can enforce a coding style that aligns with your team's preferences and project requirements.--DIVIDER--#### Customizing linter configuration\n\nBoth Flake8 and Pylint allow you to customize their configurations to enforce your preferred coding style. To do this, you can create a configuration file in your project's root directory.\n\n- For Flake8, create a `.flake8` file with the following example content:\n\n  ```\n  [flake8]\n  max-line-length = 100\n  ignore = E203, W503\n  ```\n\n  In this example, we've set the maximum line length to 100 characters and have chosen to ignore specific PEP8 rules (E203 and W503).\n\n- For Pylint, create a `pylintrc` file with the following example content:\n\n  ```\n  [MASTER]\n  max-line-length = 100\n\n  [MESSAGES CONTROL]\n  disable = C0301\n  ```\n\n  Similar to the Flake8 configuration, we've set the maximum line length to 100 characters and disabled rule C0301, which corresponds to the line length rule.\n\n#### Customizing formatter configuration\n\nBoth Black and Autopep8 allow you to customize their configurations to format your code according to your preferred style.\n\n- For Black, you can create a `pyproject.toml` file in your project's root directory with the following example content:\n\n  ```\n  [tool.black]\n  line-length = 100\n  ```\n\n  In this example, we've set the maximum line length to 100 characters.\n\n- For Autopep8, you can pass command-line arguments to customize its behavior, as shown in this example:\n\n  ```\n  autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive --max-line-length 100 your_script.py\n  ```\n\n  Here, we've set the maximum line length to 100 characters.\n--DIVIDER--# Balancing PEP8 with Practicality\n\nWhile adhering to the PEP8 style guide is important for maintaining consistent, readable, and maintainable Python code, it's also crucial to balance the strict application of PEP8 rules with practicality and readability in real-world projects. In this section, we will discuss some guidelines for striking this balance.\n\n1. Prioritize readability over strict adherence:\n\nAlthough PEP8 provides a great set of guidelines for writing readable code, sometimes strict adherence to these rules can actually make the code less readable. In such cases, it's important to prioritize readability over strict PEP8 compliance. For example, you might break the line length limit if it improves readability or if breaking the line would make the code more difficult to understand.\n\n2. Adapt PEP8 rules to your team's preferences and project requirements:\n\nDifferent teams and projects may have unique requirements and preferences when it comes to coding style. Instead of blindly following PEP8 rules, it's essential to adapt them to fit your team's needs. You can customize the configuration of linters and formatters to enforce a coding style that aligns with your team's preferences and project requirements. For example, you might choose a different maximum line length or modify the rules for naming conventions.\n\n3. Use comments and docstrings effectively:\n\nWhile PEP8 provides guidelines for the formatting of comments and docstrings, it's also important to focus on their content. Write clear, concise, and informative comments and docstrings that explain the purpose and functionality of your code. This practice will make your code more understandable and maintainable for your team members and future contributors.\n\n4. Use common sense\n\nWhen in doubt, use common sense and communicate with your team members to determine the best course of action. Discuss any changes or deviations from PEP8 rules with your team to ensure everyone is on the same page and understands the reasoning behind the decision. Also, be open to feedback from your team members and be willing to revise your code to enhance its readability and maintainability.--DIVIDER--# Summary\n\nIn this tutorial, we introduced the PEP8 style guide and discussed its importance for maintaining consistent, readable, and maintainable Python code. We covered key PEP8 recommendations, such as naming conventions, indentation, line length, whitespace, imports, and more. We also discussed using linters and formatters, such as Flake8, Pylint, Black, and Autopep8, to check and enforce PEP8 compliance. Furthermore, we explored integrating PEP8 checks into development workflows, striking a balance between PEP8 recommendations and practicality, and customizing PEP8 rules to fit your team's preferences and project requirements. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Python code remains readable and maintainable, ultimately resulting in better collaboration and higher-quality projects.\n",

In this lesson, you'll learn key building blocks, common multi-agent architectures, and the pitfalls to avoid when designing collaborative AI systems.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--# This Is Not Improv: Multi-Agent Systems Need Blueprints \ud83d\udcd0\n\nIn the early days of deep learning, we used to see posts like this:\n\n> _\u201cLook at this neural network I built! It has 300 million trainable parameters. It's beautiful!\u201d_\n\nToday, in the age of agentic AI, there\u2019s a new kind of brag:\n\n> _\u201cCheck out this system I built! It has 20 agents working together, using over 100 tools. It's beautiful!\u201d_\n\nBut here\u2019s the question we _should_ be asking more often:\n\n> **Did you need that much complexity?** > **Did you try something simpler first?** > **How did you decide on that architecture?**\n\nJust like in ML, **more is not always better**. The ability to spin up a fleet of agents with frameworks such as CrewAI or LangGraph in just a few lines of code is empowering \u2014 but also dangerously tempting. Without thoughtful design, you end up with systems that are:\n\n- \u274c **Slow** \u2014 every agent and tool call adds latency\n- \ud83d\udcb8 **Expensive** \u2014 costs add up as systems get more complex\n- \ud83e\udde9 **Unreliable** \u2014 more moving parts = more failure points\n- \ud83e\udd2f **Hard to debug** \u2014 especially when agents depend on each other\u2019s outputs\n- \ud83c\udf00 **Loop-prone** \u2014 agents get stuck checking each other\u2019s work, endlessly\n\nJust because you _can_ add another agent doesn\u2019t mean you _should_.\n\nSo, this week is about **design, not demos** \u2014 **discipline, not vibes**.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n# \ud83e\uddf1 Building Blocks of Agentic Systems\n\nTo design agentic systems systematically, you need to think in three levels of abstraction:\n\n1. **Primitives** \u2013 the atomic units: LLM calls, memory, tools, and conditional branch\n2. **Workflow Patterns** \u2013 how primitives are composed: sequences, routers, parallel calls, orchestrators, and more\n3. **Agentic Patterns** \u2013 how multiple workflows interact: supervisor, hierarchical, reflective, and other multi-agent designs\n\nThis layered approach helps you reason clearly about design choices \u2014 and avoid spaghetti systems that are hard to debug, slow to run, and painful to evolve.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through each layer.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n## Primitives: The Building Blocks of Agentic Systems\n\nLet's start with the foundational units \u2014 the **primitives** you'll use to construct graphs and design agentic behavior.\n\nThese are the core elements that make up nearly every system, no matter how complex:\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Logic Node\n\nThis is where the system processes information \u2014 either through LLM reasoning or programmatic logic. Logic nodes process input and emit output, and can be used for tasks like reasoning, planning, computing, summarizing, and more.\n\n> Example: An LLM that answers a user question. A Python function that validates schema. A scoring heuristic.\n\n### \u27a1\ufe0f Edge: Connection Between Nodes\n\nA connection between nodes that defines flow and data transfer. Edges can be simple (always execute) or conditional (execute based on state or logic). They determine both the sequence of operations and what information passes between nodes.\n\n> Example: A fixed link from \"input\" to \"processor.\" A conditional edge that routes to different nodes based on task type.\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Tool\n\nA callable interface to external functionality. Tools are how agents interact with the world \u2014 from querying databases to calling APIs or running code. They may have side effects or return structured information.\n:::info{title=\"Info\"}\nTools are usually called by nodes, though in LangGraph they may be wrapped and represented as nodes themselves.\n:::\n\n> Example: A search engine wrapper, a calculator, a code execution function.\n\n### \ud83d\udcbe Memory\n\nA storage unit for context \u2014 persistent across steps or sessions. Memory lets your system \"remember\" prior inputs, outputs, or decisions, and use them to inform future steps. In most cases, memory is injected into logic nodes via prompt augmentation.\n\n> Example: A conversation history store, a task scratchpad, or a persistent knowledge base.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n## Workflow Patterns: The \u201cCells\u201d of Agentic Systems\n\nIf primitives are the molecules, **workflow patterns are the cells** \u2014 functional units built from those pieces, each designed to solve a specific kind of problem.\n\nJust like biology has muscle cells for motion, neurons for signaling, and immune cells for defense, agentic systems rely on reusable structures that solve different types of tasks. Learn these, and you\u2019ll start spotting them everywhere.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the foundational patterns you\u2019ll use again and again:\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n![workflow-patterns.png](workflow-patterns.png)--DIVIDER--\n### \ud83d\udd17 Chain (Sequential)\n\nThe simplest pattern: a straight line. One thing happens, then the next.\n\nChains are perfect for tasks with a fixed order \u2014 preprocess \u2192 act \u2192 tidy up. Our publication pipeline works this way: extract metadata \u2192 summarize content \u2192 generate tags \u2192 format output.\n\nThey\u2019re easy to debug and reason about. But brittle \u2014 if one step fails, everything downstream breaks.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd00 Router\n\nA router adds decision-making. It inspects the input and chooses the next step.\n\nThis is where agentic behavior starts to emerge \u2014 the system isn\u2019t just following instructions, it\u2019s making choices.\n\n> At Ready Tensor, we use a router to triage publications: research papers go through expert review, student projects go to peer review, and applied solutions follow a separate track.\n\n---\n\n### \u2630 Parallelism\n\nNot all tasks need to happen in sequence. If they\u2019re independent, run them in parallel.\n\nThis saves time and brings in multiple perspectives. But it also means reconciling outputs \u2014 which can get messy if the results conflict.\n\n:::info{title=\"Parallelism for Map-Reduce\"}\n\u26a0\ufe0f Note: This pattern is ideal for map-reduce style operations \u2014 where you apply the same logic across many inputs (map) and then combine the outputs (reduce). \n:::\n\n> In our evaluation engine, 100+ assessment criteria are computed independently in parallel. Once done, the results are merged into a single scorecard.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfad Generator\u2013Evaluator Loop\n\nOne node creates, another critiques. The result improves over time.\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful pattern \u2014 summaries, plans, reference lists, and more can all benefit from refinement. But it needs clear exit conditions to avoid infinite loops.\n\n> In our authoring assistant, the generator proposes a list of references based on the content. The evaluator checks for accuracy. If it's not good enough, the generator tries again \u2014 up to three times.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Orchestrator\n\nWhen the task is too complex or dynamic for a chain or router, it\u2019s time to orchestrate.\n\nThe orchestrator decomposes the task, assigns subtasks to the right workflows, and coordinates the results. It can plan, reason, and adapt \u2014 using techniques like chain-of-thought or self-ask to break problems down.\n\n> At Ready Tensor, we use orchestrators to coordinate publication evaluation and authoring. They decide which agents to call, what sequence to follow, and how to assemble the final output.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 Retry / Fallback\n\nWhen things go wrong, don\u2019t crash \u2014 try again or try something else.\n\nThis pattern adds robustness. A node retries if it fails, or falls back to an alternate method. It\u2019s simple to implement but dramatically improves reliability.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n## \ud83e\udde0 Agentic Patterns: Collaboration at the System Level\nWorkflow patterns define how a few nodes combine into _functional units_. **Agentic patterns** define how those units combine into _larger, more capable systems_.\n\nThese are your high-level coordination and collaboration strategies \u2014 architectural blueprints for behavior once you move beyond single-agent setups.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through core patterns:--DIVIDER--\n![agentic-patterns.png](agentic-patterns.png)\n\n--DIVIDER--\n### \ud83c\udfed Assembly Line\n\nA chain of agents, each handling a distinct part of the task. Like a factory line, work is passed from one agent to the next.\n\nThis pattern mirrors the **Chain** workflow \u2014 but here, each step is handled by a full-fledged agent (or even a workflow cell). That means each stage can involve its own reasoning, tools, or even subroutines.\n\n> Example: A content pipeline with agents for research \u2192 drafting \u2192 editing \u2192 fact-checking \u2192 formatting.\n\nIt\u2019s modular and easy to reason about \u2014 ideal for **structured**, **repeatable**, and **multi-step** processes. But there\u2019s a catch: errors compound as they move downstream. If the output is wrong at the end, tracing it back can be tough.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\ude9e Reflection\n\nThis mirrors the **generator\u2013evaluator** workflow \u2014 but at the agentic level.\n\nHere, one agent generates a response, and another agent evaluates it. Based on feedback, the generator may refine its output. The key difference is that these aren\u2019t just function nodes \u2014 they can be full agents, possibly running their own internal workflows or logic.\n\nUsed for: improving quality and correcting reasoning errors.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Supervisor\n\nOne agent oversees the work of others \u2014 assigning tasks, checking outputs, or deciding when to intervene.\n\nSupervisors are useful for **delegation**, **quality control**, and **system-level decision-making**.\n\nThis mirrors the orchestration workflow pattern \u2014 but instead of static logic, a dynamic agent decides what to do, when, and with whom.\n\n> The supervisor doesn\u2019t just call nodes; it reasons about the task and manages specialized agents. Each agent it supervises might itself run a full workflow \u2014 like a chain or generator\u2013evaluator loop \u2014 making this a higher-order composition of agents and workflows.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\ude9c Hierarchical\n\nAgents are arranged in a hierarchy \u2014 with higher-level agents breaking down tasks and lower-level agents executing them.\n\nThis is an extension of the supervisor pattern, but with multiple levels of delegation. Each layer manages the one below, forming a cascading structure of control and execution.\n\nThis mirrors organizational structures in human teams. It\u2019s ideal when tasks can be decomposed cleanly, and subtasks can be handled independently.\n\n> For example, a project manager agent might delegate to team lead agents for writing, data analysis, and design \u2014 and each of those might in turn manage specialist agents (e.g., a graph creator, a fact-checker, or a code explainer).\n\nHierarchies help manage complexity through abstraction and role separation, but they also introduce challenges like coordination overhead, latency, and error propagation across levels.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd4a Competitive Pattern\n\nMultiple agents tackle the same task independently \u2014 and the system selects or synthesizes the best result.\n\nThis encourages **diversity of thought**, often leading to more robust or creative solutions. Agents may differ in prompting strategies, tools used, or model types. The outputs can then be judged by a scoring function, a critique agent, or even a voting mechanism.\n\n> Popular in tasks like summarization, code generation, planning \u2014 where there's no single \u201cright\u201d answer.\n\nThe final output might come from a **winner-takes-all** selection, a **consensus vote**, or a **blended response** \u2014 echoing the \u201c**wisdom of the crowd**\u201d principle.\n\nWhile powerful, this pattern increases compute usage and evaluation complexity. Use it when the value of better results outweighs the cost.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf10 Network\n\nAgents operate in a loose, decentralized network \u2014 communicating with each other, sometimes recursively, to achieve a shared goal.\n\nThere\u2019s no fixed hierarchy. Instead, coordination emerges from the interactions themselves.\n\n> This pattern is powerful for brainstorming, consensus-building, or solving problems with no clear linear flow.\n\nBut it\u2019s also the hardest to debug \u2014 feedback loops, message passing, and unclear boundaries can lead to emergent behaviors (both good and bad). This pattern isn't used that often in production systems.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n## \ud83e\udde9 Real-World Systems Combine Patterns\n\nMost production-grade agentic systems don\u2019t use a single pattern. Instead, they combine several \u2014 sometimes within the same workflow.\n\nA reflective agent might operate inside a hierarchical system. A supervisor might choose between competing outputs. A network of agents might contain internal chains or routers.\n\nThat\u2019s the art of agentic system design: **knowing the patterns**, understanding their strengths and limitations, and combining them thoughtfully to match the task.\n\nSimple systems work better when they\u2019re _simple on purpose_ \u2014 and complex systems work best when they\u2019re **composed from understandable parts**.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Antipatterns to Avoid\n\nEven with great patterns, things can go wrong. These common pitfalls lead to brittle, inefficient, or confusing agentic systems:\n--DIVIDER--\n### \ud83e\uddf0 One Agent to Rule Them All\n\nDesigning a single agent to handle everything.\nThis creates a **Swiss Army Knife Agent** \u2014 overloaded and underperforming. It lacks clarity, makes debugging harder, and breaks down under pressure. Give each agent a clear, focused role. Think **Single Responsibility Principle**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf1 Death by a Thousand Agents\n\nDesigning one agent per tiny task.\nThis results in **agent bloat** \u2014 too many agents, each doing too little. It increases overhead, adds coordination complexity, and blurs accountability. Prefer fewer, more capable agents, and use **workflows (cells)** for internal steps. Apply the **KISS principle** - Keep It Simple, Stupid.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 The LLM Hammer\n\nTreating every node like an agent \u2014 even when it doesn\u2019t need to be.\n\nNot every task needs reasoning, reflection, or natural language understanding. Wrapping every step in an LLM adds latency, cost, and unpredictability. Some things are better handled with regular logic, deterministic code, or fast lookups.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Having an agent \"decide\" between two predetermined options when a simple if/else would work\n- Using an LLM to parse structured data that could be handled with regex or a simple parser\n- Prompting for arithmetic or other math operations (\"What's 15% of $240?\")\n- Wrapping simple API calls (like updating a database record) in agent tools when direct function calls would work\n\n> Just because you can prompt it, doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd17 The Chain of Pain\n\nDesigning overly lengthy sequence of agents that depend on each other.\nThis makes systems **fragile and slow**. If one step fails or drifts in quality, downstream outputs degrade \u2014 and you won\u2019t know where it broke. Because everything runs in sequence, speed suffers too.\n\nInstead, break chains into modular units with clear boundaries. Validate outputs between steps, test them independently, and parallelize where possible.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd39 Blurred Boundaries\n\nAssigning multiple agents vague or poorly defined roles.\n\nThis often leads to **conflicting actions, duplicated work, or contradictory outputs** \u2014 not because agents are faulty, but because their responsibilities aren\u2019t clearly scoped. It\u2019s one of the most common sources of confusion in multi-agent systems.\n\nAvoid this by designing clear, non-overlapping roles. Define who acts, who verifies, and who decides \u2014 and ensure the handoffs are unambiguous.\n\n> Good fences make good agents.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f Falling Through the Cracks\n\nLeaving parts of the workflow undefined.\n\nThis causes the opposite problem as the one above: no agent or tool is responsible.\n\nWhen no agent or tool owns a task, critical steps go unhandled. Apply the **MECE principle** \u2014 make responsibilities **mutually exclusive** (no overlap) and **collectively exhaustive** (no gaps).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 No Escape Hatch\n\nDesigning loops with no cap, limit, or fail-safe.\n\nThis is one of the most common failure modes in agentic systems \u2014 nodes stuck in a loop without making progress. It often looks like thinking, but nothing gets done.\n\n**Common causes include:**\n\n- Output parsing failures that prevent state from advancing\n- Tool or API errors that always trigger retries\n- Mismatched responsibilities \u2014 e.g., an evaluator checks for criteria the generator never produces\n- Loops without a cap \u2014 no confidence threshold, retry limit, or timeout\n\nEvery loop needs an **escape hatch**. Otherwise, your system might just spin forever.\n\n-----DIVIDER--# \u2705 Wrapping Up: Patterns Before Agents\n\nBefore we jump into building agents, it\u2019s critical to understand **how they\u2019ll interact** \u2014 and what workflows they\u2019ll drive.\n\nIn this lesson, we covered:\n\n* **Workflow Patterns (Cells):** Building blocks like chains, retries, forks, and orchestration \u2014 the logic that defines *how* things get done.\n* **Agentic Patterns:** Higher-level coordination strategies like supervision, reflection, or competition \u2014 the logic that defines *who* does what.\n* **Common Antipatterns:** Pitfalls like agent bloat, long chains, or infinite loops that make systems fragile or inefficient.\n\nThese patterns help you design systems that are **modular**, **adaptable**, and **maintainable** \u2014 whether you're using simple tools or building multi-agent ecosystems.\n\nNext up, we\u2019ll start assembling these pieces into actual agentic systems using **LangGraph**. But keep this principle in mind:\n\n> **Every node in your graph is either a tool, an agent, or a cell.**\n> And sometimes\u2026 it's all three.\n\nYou now have the vocabulary to design smart systems \u2014 not just smart agents.\n--DIVIDER--\n---\n\n[\ud83c\udfe0 Home - All Lessons](https://app.readytensor.ai/hubs/ready_tensor_certifications)  \n\n[\u2b05\ufe0f Previous - Week 6 Preview](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/Xwoyw4yqjAGg) \n[\u27a1\ufe0f Next - Agentic Authoring Assistant](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/Gq1xQ27DmJ56) \n\n---",

We dive into the tag extraction subsystem as a design case study, exploring how to combine rule-based methods (gazetteer), ML models (NER), and LLM-based approaches. The key focus is on architectural decision-making: determining where agents add value versus where traditional tools and functions are more appropriate in real-world systems.\n\n---\n\n--DIVIDER--\n# \ud83d\ude80 From Patterns to Practice\n\nIn the last lesson, we explored the building blocks of agentic systems \u2014 workflow patterns, agent coordination strategies, and the common pitfalls to avoid. But knowing the patterns is only half the story.\n\nThe real challenge?\n**Figuring out when and how to use them.**\n\nBecause your goal isn\u2019t to make a system _agentic_ for its own sake.\nYour goal is to **solve a problem** \u2014 and do it with an architecture that\u2019s effective, efficient, and maintainable.\n\nSometimes that means using agents.\nSometimes it means calling a function, running a model, or just keeping it simple.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what this lesson is all about.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# \ud83c\udfaf Designing with Purpose\n\nIn this lesson, we introduce a real-world project that\u2019s relevant, open-ended, and full of architectural tradeoffs. There\u2019s no single right answer \u2014 but there are definitely better and worse ones.\n\nYou can always try different architectures and see what works \u2014 and in fact, next week we\u2019ll talk about how to evaluate and compare them. But for now, your focus should be on **designing with intent**.\n\n> **What\u2019s the problem?** \n> **What\u2019s the cleanest, smartest way to solve it?** \n> **Where do agents actually make sense?**\n\nThis is your chance to take what you\u2019ve learned about agentic architectures and apply it to something practical. Something useful. And yes \u2014 something fun.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# \u270d\ufe0f The Project: An Agentic Authoring Assistant (A3) System\n\nAt Ready Tensor, we want the process of writing and sharing AI projects to feel less like a chore \u2014 and more like a creative extension of the work itself. That means helping authors focus on their insights and innovations, while we take care of the supporting structure. We call it the **Agentic Authoring Assistant (A3)** system.\n\nWe\u2019re not building the system to write full publications (yet), but we _can_ assist with key elements \u2014 especially the ones that improve presentation, discoverability, and completeness.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A clear, compelling **title**\n- Relevant **tags** for search and discovery\n- A concise **TL;DR summary**\n- A visually engaging **hero image**\n- A handful of **references** to provide additional context\n\nSome of these are metadata. Others enhance presentation or completeness. Together, they help package a project more clearly and professionally \u2014 making it easier to share, showcase, and engage with.\n\nThe task cannot be accomplished with a simple one-shot prompt or linear chain. It needs a **modular, multi-step system** with very different types of tasks \u2014 those that require reasoning, others that rely on tools, and some that are more extractive or deterministic.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly why it\u2019s interesting. You\u2019ll need to decide:\n\n- Which parts need agents? Which ones don\u2019t?\n- Which agentic patterns apply here?\n- Where should tools be used?\n- What runs in parallel? What runs sequentially?\n\nThis is the perfect sandbox to apply everything you learned about architecture in the last lesson \u2014 and to start thinking like a system designer, not just a prompt engineer.\n\nIn this lesson, we\u2019ll zoom in on one component of that system: tag extraction \u2014 a task that looks simple, but turns out to be a great test case for agentic thinking.\n\nLet\u2019s dig in.\n\n---\n\n--DIVIDER--\n# \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f The Tag Extraction Subsystem\n\nLet\u2019s take one piece of the authoring assistant and break it down: **tag extraction**.\n\nThe goal is to identify relevant tags \u2014 short, descriptive keywords that capture the main ideas, methods, tools, or domains in a project. These tags help categorize the project and make it easier to discover through search or filtering.\n\nIt sounds simple. But instead of relying on a single method, we\u2019ll use a **three-pronged approach** to increase coverage and robustness:\n\n1. **Gazetteer-based**: A simple, rule-based method that scans the text for known terms from a predefined list (our gazetteer).\n2. **NER-based**: A named entity recognition model using **spaCy** to extract proper nouns and technical terms from the text.\n3. **LLM-based**: A prompt-driven method where the model suggests tags based on its understanding of the content.\n\nEach method returns a set of candidate tags. We\u2019ll take the **union** of those results and use an LLM to select the **top _n_ tags**, aiming for clarity, specificity, and relevance.\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Info\"}\n\n<h2>What is a Gazetteer</h2>\n\nA gazetteer is just a predefined list of known terms \u2014 like a custom dictionary. In this case, it\u2019s a simple list of domain-specific keywords (e.g., \u201ctransformers\u201d, \u201cgradient descent\u201d, \u201cRAG\u201d) that you want to check for in the project text.\n\nYou can store this list in a basic text or CSV file, and use simple string matching or regex to scan for matches in the content. It\u2019s fast, easy to implement, and great for catching common terms that other methods might miss.\n:::\n\n--DIVIDER--\nAt this point, you might be wondering:\n\n> > _\u201cBut wait \u2014 a gazetteer and an NER model don\u2019t sound like agentic AI\u2026\u201d_\n\nAnd you\u2019d be absolutely right. That\u2019s the point.\n\nReal-world systems aren\u2019t made of agents alone. They\u2019re composed of traditional ML models, rule-based components, business logic, and agentic AI layered in where it makes sense. Building intelligent systems means knowing how to combine these elements \u2014 and when to reach for each one.\n\nAs an agentic AI developer, part of your job is to design with that full toolbox in mind. Agentic systems don\u2019t replace everything else \u2014 they complement and extend it. This project is your chance to practice thinking that way.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# \ud83e\udd14 So What\u2019s the Design Challenge?\n\nEven for a task like this, there are many architectural decisions to make \u2014 and none of them are obvious:\n\n- Where do we use agents, and where do we use regular function calls?\n- Should each extraction method be handled by a separate agent, or should they be tools called by a single controller?\n- Should the methods run in parallel, or in sequence? Does the order matter?\n- Is the final tag selector best implemented as a tool, an agent, or a scoring function?\n- Should you use reasoning strategies like chain-of-thought or few-shot prompting for the LLM-based steps?\n-  Do we need a reflection agent to check the quality of extracted tags? \n\nEven something as \u201csimple\u201d as tagging turns out to be a great microcosm of agentic system design \u2014 blending tools, workflows, and modular decision-making.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Your Turn to Design\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn: try implementing your own version of the tag extraction system.\n\nStart small if you like \u2014 build just one of the extraction methods, or get the full union + selection loop working with minimal prompts. The goal isn\u2019t perfection. It\u2019s to think like a system builder, make intentional choices, and bring the architecture to life.\n\n> What will your design look like?\n> Where will you use agents? Where will you rely on tools?\n> How will you handle complexity without overcomplicating the system?\n\nBuild something. Try it out. Experiment.\n\nWe'll show you how we approached it in the [next lesson.](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/D3vJsJh1500g)\n--DIVIDER--\n---\n\n[\ud83c\udfe0 Home - All Lessons](https://app.readytensor.ai/hubs/ready_tensor_certifications)  \n\n[\u2b05\ufe0f Previous - Design Patterns for Multi-Agent AI Systems](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/Sp2HOfRpH4Fl) \n[\u27a1\ufe0f Next - Tag Extraction System](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/D3vJsJh1500g) \n\n---",

You\u2019ll explore a real-world LangGraph system that combines three different extraction methods and uses an LLM to select the best tags. Along the way, we unpack the design choices, patterns, and tradeoffs that shaped the system \u2014 and reflect on where agents might fit in.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# \ud83e\udded From Vision to Code\n\nIn the [last lesson](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/Gq1xQ27DmJ56), we introduced our Week 6 project \u2014 an **Agentic Authoring Assistant** to help generate titles, tags, summaries, hero images, and references for AI publications. As a learning exercise, we scoped down to one essential subsystem: **tag extraction**.\n\nWe described the design challenge, outlined the system\u2019s requirements, and encouraged you to think through your own solution.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen that lesson yet \u2014 or want a refresher on the architectural context \u2014 we strongly recommend you check it out first. It sets the stage for everything we\u2019re about to build.\n\n> \ud83d\udcce [Go to \u201cDefining Our Agentic Authoring Assistant\u201d \u2192](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/Gq1xQ27DmJ56)\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n# \ud83e\uddf1 The System at a Glance\n\nLet\u2019s start with a quick overview of the system we actually built.\n--DIVIDER--\n![tag-extractor-graph.jpg](tag-extractor-graph.jpg)--DIVIDER--The tag extractor is implemented as a **LangGraph**, with five key nodes:\n\n- A **Start node** that fans out to three parallel extraction methods:\n\n  - One using a simple **gazetteer lookup**\n  - One using **spaCy\u2019s NER model**\n  - One using an **LLM-based extraction method**\n\n- An **Aggregation node** that collects the results and uses an LLM to select the top _n_ final tags.\n- An **End node** to close out the workflow.\n\nIt\u2019s a small graph \u2014 but it surfaces a surprising number of interesting design decisions.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--:::info{title=\"Code + Video Walkthrough\"}\n\n<h2>\ud83d\udcbb Want to explore the implementation? </h2>\n\nThe full code repository is linked with this lesson \u2014 and if you'd like a guided walkthrough, you\u2019ll find a **video explanation near the bottom** of the page.  \n\nIt covers the key components, node logic, and design decisions behind the system. Whether you prefer reading code or watching it in action, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n\n:::\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--# \u2753 From Design to Decisions: What Did We Actually Build?\n\nNow that you've seen it from above, let\u2019s zoom in \u2014 not with code, but with answers to the kinds of questions a thoughtful system designer would ask.\n\nWe\u2019ve grouped these questions into four themes:\n\n- \ud83e\udde0 **System Design & Architecture**\n- \ud83e\udd16 **Agentic Thinking**\n- \ud83e\udde9 **LLMs, Tools & Reasoning**\n- \ud83e\uddfc **Simplifications, Improvements & Production Readiness**\n\nEach one explores a different aspect of how (and why) we built the system the way we did. If you're building your own version or just curious how agentic thinking shows up in practice \u2014 this is where it gets interesting.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n---\n\n--DIVIDER--\n## \ud83e\udde0 **System Design & Architecture**\n\n<h3>What architectural pattern does this follow?</h3>\nIt\u2019s a simple **fan-out, fan-in** graph \u2014 the start node fans out to three parallel extraction methods, and their results feed into an aggregation node. You could also think of it as a lightweight **map-reduce** pattern.\n\n<h3>Why did we use three extraction methods instead of one?</h3>\nBecause that\u2019s how real systems work. Not everything needs to be a prompt. The gazetteer is fast and rule-based. spaCy brings proven ML capabilities. The LLM adds flexible reasoning. One goal of this lesson is to reinforce that agentic systems often combine traditional business logic, ML components, and LLM reasoning \u2014 each where it fits best. Use LLMs when you need intelligence, not just automation.\n\n<h3>Why not just do everything in a single LLM call?</h3>\nYou could \u2014 but you'd lose control, explainability, and reusability. Breaking it into steps lets us mix techniques, inspect outputs, and improve individual components over time. It\u2019s also cheaper to avoid over-relying on the LLM.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n## \ud83e\udd16 **Agentic Thinking**\n\n<h3>How many agents did we use in this system?</h3>\n\nZero. That\u2019s right \u2014 no agents here. And that\u2019s okay. This particular task didn\u2019t require multi-turn decision-making, autonomy, or dynamic behavior. Everything was deterministic and direct.  \n\nThat said, we **do** have two LLM-powered steps \u2014 one for extraction and one for aggregation \u2014 both of which involve reasoning. But these are simple function calls, not autonomous agents.\n\nStill, our results do show some **performance gaps** \u2014 especially in **tag quality and classification accuracy**. So while we didn\u2019t use any agents in this version, it might make sense to introduce a **reflection or verification agent** in the future \u2014 one that reviews extracted tags, revises weak ones, or flags possible misses.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a failure of agentic thinking \u2014 it\u2019s an example of it. We start simple, test assumptions, and introduce agents only when the problem demands it.\n\n<h3>So\u2026 is this even agentic?</h3>\nYes \u2014 just not in the traditional \u201cgive the agent a goal and let it run\u201d sense. The design and orchestration mindset is agentic: we\u2019re using modularity, tool usage, and reasoning steps where appropriate. Think of it as agentic architecture, even if we didn\u2019t need agentic autonomy here.\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Why didn\u2019t we use agents to call the tools?</h3>\nBecause there\u2019s no real decision to make. Each tool is always run with known arguments. There\u2019s no ambiguity, no reasoning-based branching or looping. Wrapping them in agents would\u2019ve added complexity with no value.\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>If we didn\u2019t use agents, why did we even create and register tools?</h3>\nBecause we want to leave the door open. These capabilities \u2014 like extracting entities \u2014 could absolutely be useful in more complex agentic systems. Registering them now means they\u2019re ready to be used later, either manually or through agents who know how to invoke them.\n\n<br>\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n## \ud83e\uddf9 LLMs, Tools & Reasoning\n\n<h3> How many LLM-powered steps are there?</h3>\n\nTwo:\n\n- One for extracting entities based on understanding (LLM-based extraction).\n- One for aggregating and selecting the top tags from all methods.\n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\n<h3> What\u2019s the role of reasoning in this system, if any? </h3>\n\nIt\u2019s subtle. The LLM-based extractor does need to understand what makes a good tag \u2014 and that involves some reasoning. The aggregation step also balances clarity, coverage, and specificity.\n\nBut we\u2019re not using explicit chain-of-thought or reflection techniques yet.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n## \ud83e\udefc Improvements & Production Readiness\n\n<h3>  Is this graph flexible? Could we swap components easily? </h3>\n\nYes \u2014 and that\u2019s one of its strengths. Want to try a different NER model? Just update the spaCy node. Want to tweak the prompt? Change the config. Want to add a verification step? Add a node.\n\nThis is one of the advantages of graph-based design: it\u2019s composable.\n\n<h3>  What would it take to make this production-ready? </h3>\n\nA lot more:\n\n- Deduplication and normalization of tags\n- Better handling of synonyms and variants (e.g. \u201cAI\u201d vs \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d)\n- Thresholds or filters for relevance\n- Human-in-the-Loop for tag validation\n- Evaluation metrics to measure tag quality\n\nThis is a learning scaffold, not a production stack \u2014 and that\u2019s by design.\n\n<h3>  What improvements could we try next? </h3>\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n- Use a multi-class text classifier to improve tag classification\n- Try fine-tuning spaCy or adding your own gazetteer terms\n- Add a verification step or reflection agent to improve tag quality\n- Implement semantic de-duplication\n- Experiment with **reasoning strategies** like _Chain-of-Thought_ or _ReAct_ in the LLM-based extractor. Thanks to our modular prompt config and builder, it\u2019s easy to try \u2014 just add the strategy to your prompt config file.\n\nThis lesson is a sandbox \u2014 take it further.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n--DIVIDER--# \ud83c\udfa5 Code Walkthrough\n\nPrefer to see it in action?\n\nCheck out the **video walkthrough** below \u2014 it covers the full implementation and key design decisions behind the system.\n\n:::youtube[Title]{#NhtU50g3Beo}\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# \u2705 Wrapping Up\n\nThis lesson showed how we translated an abstract architecture into a working system \u2014 combining traditional logic, ML models, and LLM-powered reasoning inside a modular LangGraph.\n\nNo agents this time. But still very much agentic.\n\nIt\u2019s a reminder that good system design means using the right tools for the job \u2014 and leaving space to evolve when the job gets more complex.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll explore how more sophisticated agentic systems handle **collaboration**, **delegation**, and **decision-making** \u2014 going beyond standalone components into dynamic, multi-agent workflows.\n--DIVIDER-----\n\n[\ud83c\udfe0 Home - All Lessons](https://app.readytensor.ai/hubs/ready_tensor_certifications)  \n\n[\u2b05\ufe0f Previous - Agentic Authoring Assistant](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/Gq1xQ27DmJ56) \n[\u27a1\ufe0f Next - Designing Right Agents](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/qtRz3uuXGx5Y) \n\n---\n",

In this lesson, you'll learn how to map the essential work first, then design skill-based agents to handle it cleanly. You'll discover common agent archetypes (from Retrievers to Validators), avoid the traps of micro-agents and mega-agents, and ensure every piece of work is covered without overlap. Part 2 will cover how to make these agents work together effectively.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# The Tag Extraction System: Behind the Choices\n\nIn the last two lessons, we walked through the [scope](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/Gq1xQ27DmJ56) and [implementation](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/D3vJsJh1500g) of the **tag extraction system**. As you followed along, you may have wondered:\n\n- _How did they decide which parts needed agents?_\n- _Why were some steps tools, others LLM calls, and some potential agents left out?_\n- _Are there actual rules for how to define agent roles and put them together into a system?_\n\nIn this lesson, we\u2019ll share our answers \u2014 not just theoretical best practices, but **practical guidance** drawn from experience. You\u2019ll learn how to scope agent responsibilities, avoid common mistakes, and build agent teams that actually collaborate \u2014 instead of stepping on each other\u2019s toes.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n# Your North Star: Solve the Problem\n\nBefore we dive into roles, responsibilities, and design patterns, let\u2019s be clear about what matters most: **your job is to solve the problem.**\n\nThat\u2019s your North Star. Not elegant architecture diagrams. Not maximizing the number of agents. Not showcasing your graph-building skills.\n\nJust build something that works \u2014 that gets the job done cleanly, reliably, and with minimal complexity.\n\nThat said, **design patterns and best practices exist for a reason**. They don\u2019t guarantee success, but they can help you avoid common pitfalls, reduce fragility, and make your system easier to debug, extend, or reuse.\n\nSo don\u2019t treat patterns like rules \u2014 treat them like guardrails. Let your problem drive the architecture, not the other way around.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n# \ud83e\udded Start With the Work, Not the Workers\n\nBefore deciding which agents to build, start with a simple question:\n**What needs to happen for this system to deliver value?**\n\nWe call this **mapping the knowledge work** \u2014 identifying the actual steps required to go from input to output. Not who does them, but what gets done.\n\nForget agent boundaries for now. Focus on the essential work:\n\n- What must be retrieved, analyzed, or generated?\n- Where is filtering, synthesis, or validation needed?\n- What handoffs happen along the way?\n\nOnly once you\u2019ve mapped this value path should you start designing the agentic system.\nThe goal isn\u2019t to maximize agents \u2014 it\u2019s to cover the right capabilities cleanly.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n# Two Extremes to Avoid\n\nWhen designing agentic systems, people often fall into one of two traps:\n\n- **One agent per task** \u2014 break everything into tiny steps and assign each to its own agent.\n- **One agent per job title** \u2014 treat agents like people: \u201cResearcher,\u201d \u201cEditor,\u201d \u201cWriter.\u201d\n\nBoth sound structured. Both usually fall apart.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 The Problem with Task-Based Agents\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re building a **References Generator** \u2014 a system that takes a project description and returns a list of relevant papers, online articles, or blog posts. You might start by splitting the process:\n\n- Extract key concepts\n- Generate search queries\n- Run a web search\n- Filter results\n- Remove duplicates\n- Rank for relevance\n- Format citations\n\nEach step becomes its own agent. You end up with a dozen tiny agents, all hard-coded to a specific function.\n\nSure, it works. But the result is:\n\n- **Too fragile** \u2014 one agent fails and rest of your assembly line breaks\n- **Not reusable** \u2014 nothing carries over to other projects\n\nTake a \u201cWeb Search Agent.\u201d If tomorrow you want to support arXiv, Google Scholar, or a custom database \u2014 do you build new agents for each?\n\nOr do you build one smart retriever agent and give it the tools it needs?\n\nThat\u2019s the difference between hard-coding and modular design.\n\nAnd when you move on to something like a **Literature Review Assistant**, the first few steps \u2014 extract concepts, search, filter \u2014 are exactly the same.\n\nIf your agents are modular, you reuse them.\nIf they\u2019re overfitted, you start over.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 The Problem with Broad Role-Based Agents\n\nOn the flip side, defining agents by job titles feels intuitive \u2014 but often leads to:\n\n- Overloaded responsibilities\n- Unpredictable behavior\n- Debugging nightmares\n\nWhat does a \u201cResearcher Agent\u201d really do? Is it searching? Filtering? Scoring? Summarizing? Fact-checking? All of the above?\n\nIf it\u2019s doing too much, it\u2019s doing too little of it well.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n\n# \u2705 The Sweet Spot: Skill-Based Agents\n\nSo what's the alternative? Focus on **skills**, not tasks or titles.\n\nSome capabilities show up everywhere \u2014 retrieving information, filtering results, judging relevance, or summarizing content. These are the building blocks you'll use across projects.\n\nBuild agents around these core skills. Make them flexible through prompt injection and structured inputs. Then compose them into workflows as needed.\n\nYour \"Web Search Agent\" becomes a \"Retrieval Agent\" that can search the web, query databases, or scan documents. Your \u201cReference Picker\u201d becomes a Selection Agent that can rank papers, choose the best tags, or filter top results in any domain given the right context.\n\nNot every agent needs to be generalized \u2014 some will be specific to your use case. But when you spot these recurring skills, design for flexibility and re-use.\n\nLet's look at the most common ones.\n\n---\n\n--DIVIDER--# \ud83e\udde0 Common Agent Roles\n\nWhen building agentic systems, certain roles come up again and again. Instead of designing agents from scratch each time, it helps to think in terms of **reusable skills** \u2014 like retrieving information, generating content, or validating outputs.\n\nBelow are the most common agent types, organized by function. These are your core building blocks \u2014 modular, composable, and useful across many systems.\n\n\n--DIVIDER--\n![common-agents.png](common-agents.png)\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--## \ud83e\udded Orchestration\n\nThese agents manage flow and structure.\n\n<h3>Planner</h3>\n\n- Breaks down a high-level goal into smaller steps.\n- Can benefit from Chain of Thought or Self-Ask for goal decomposition.\n- No tools needed.\n\n<h3>Coordinator</h3>\n\n- Manages branching logic or parallel execution.\n- No tools or reasoning typically required \u2014 implemented with graph logic.\n--DIVIDER--\n## \ud83d\udd0d Information Retrieval\n\nThese agents gather and organize relevant inputs.\n\n<h3>Retriever </h3>\n\n- Locates relevant content via search or queries.\n- Examples: Web search (SerpAPI), vector DB lookup (Pinecone), database queries.\n- Requires tools.\n- No reasoning usually required.\n\n<h3>Extractor  </h3>\n\n- Identifies concepts, terms, or entities from text.\n- Examples: Tag extraction, topic detection, NER.\n- May use tools like spaCy or keyword matchers, or topic detection models.\n\n<h3>Selector </h3>\n\n- Chooses or ranks the best results from a list.\n- Examples: Pick top-n tags, select best answer from candidate responses.\n- Can benefit from rationale-based selection or reflection-based ranking.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Content Processing & Creation\n\nThese agents transform or synthesize content.\n\n<h3>Generator  </h3>\n\n- Produces original content from context and instructions.\n- Examples: Answer a question, write a title, draft an abstract.\n- Can benefit from Chain of Thought, Few-shot, or ReAct.\n\n<h3>Summarizer</h3>\n\n- Condenses content while preserving key meaning.\n- Examples: TL;DR, highlights, executive summaries.\n- Reasoning may help when summarizing lengthy context. Can benefit from few-shot examples.\n\n<h3>Refiner </h3>\n\n- Improves or adapts existing content.\n- Examples: Simplify language, change tone, change/fix structure.\n- Can benefit from feedback loops or few-shot examples.\n\n<h3>Analyzer </h3>\n\n- Examines data to extract insights or patterns.\n- Examples: Sentiment trends, evaluation results, sql query or pandas analysis.\n- Typically needs external tools (e.g., stats, sql, tabular analysis tools).\n\n<h3>Aggregator  </h3>\n\n- Merges multiple outputs into a single result. Typically for _reduce_ operations in map-reduce style tasks.\n- Examples: Combine candidate tags, stitch together summaries.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n## \u2705 Evaluation\n\nThese agents judge and improve quality.\n\n<h3>Reviewer</h3>\n\n- Critiques and suggests improvements. Usually part of **generate-reflect** loops.\n- Examples: Writing feedback, tone/style issues, structure comments.\n- Can benefit from few-shot and reflective prompting.\n\n<h3>Validator</h3>\n\n- Checks for strict correctness rules. Flags issues or confirms compliance.\n- Examples: Fact-checking, completeness-check, checklists.\n- Often uses tools like checkers, regex, or structured validators. Reasoning not typically needed.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n## \u2699\ufe0f Action\n\nThese agents trigger effects beyond the system.\n\n<h3>Executor</h3>\n\n- Performs real-world actions. Logic is typically deterministic. Agentic out of convenience, not necessity.\n- Examples: Send email, save to DB, call external APIs, post to Slack.\n- Always tool-based. No reasoning required.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n# From Skills to Structure: Assigning the Right Work to the Right Agents\n\nBy now, you\u2019ve done the groundwork. You\u2019ve clarified the problem, mapped the key work involved, identified the core skills required, and chosen the agents to match.\n\nNow comes the important next step:\n**Assign that work cleanly \u2014 and make sure every piece is covered.**\n\nThis is where things can go wrong if you\u2019re not careful. Even with the right agents in hand, it\u2019s easy to:\n\n- Leave out a necessary step (a gap)\n- Give two agents overlapping jobs (a conflict)\n\nLet\u2019s look at how to spot those before they trip you up.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Example: A Gap in the Pipeline\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re building a system that pulls external content into an article:\n\n1. **Retriever** runs a web search and returns 10 results\n2. **Selector** picks the top 3 most relevant results\n3. **Generator** uses them to answer a research question\n\nSounds reasonable \u2014 until you look closer.\n\nWeb pages are full of clutter: ads, headers, unrelated text. Even your \u201cbest\u201d results still contain noise. If you pass those raw into the Generator, you\u2019re setting it up to fail.\n\n> What\u2019s missing? A **Summarizer** or **Refiner** to clean and compress the selected results before generating anything.\n\nThat\u2019s a gap. A skill your system needs \u2014 but doesn\u2019t have.\n\n---\n\n## \u267b\ufe0f Example: An Overlap in the Flow\n\nNow imagine you\u2019ve assigned both a **Summarizer** and a **Refiner** to process the same text.\n\n- The Summarizer shortens it.\n- The Refiner rewrites it for tone and clarity.\n\nDo you need both? Or is one doing the other\u2019s job?\n\n> Overlaps create unnecessary complexity \u2014 and make debugging painful.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 The Fix: Trace the Information Path\n\nWalk through your system and ask:\n\n- What does each agent receive?\n- What\u2019s the output supposed to be? What does it actually look like?\n- Is anything noisy, unstructured, or missing?\n- Are two agents doing the same thing?\n\nMapping the flow helps catch what\u2019s missing \u2014 and what\u2019s unnecessary.\n\n-----DIVIDER--\n## \ud83e\uddf1 From Agents to Pipeline\n\nSo now you've mapped the whole system: the knowledge work is covered, the agents are clearly defined, and the value path flows from start to finish.\n\nTempted to string it all into one neat sequence?\n\n**Hold up.**\n\nJust having the right agents in the right order doesn\u2019t guarantee a working system. In agentic AI, **collaboration matters** \u2014 and that means thinking beyond just who does what.\n\nTo make your system _robust and reliable_, you\u2019ll need:\n\n- **Checkpoints** to verify quality along the way\n- **Parallelization** to speed things up when steps don\u2019t depend on each other\n- **Controllers** to manage flow, retries, and fallback paths\n\nIn other words: good agents need a good playbook. Without it, you'll face coordination breakdowns, cascade failures, and the kind of multi-agent chaos that makes debugging a nightmare.\n\nWe\u2019ll cover all of that in **Part 2**.\n\n---\n--DIVIDER--\n# \u25b6\ufe0f Coming Up:\n\n**_Building the Dream Team: Making Agents Work as a Team_**\nHow to coordinate agents, structure collaboration, and build systems that hold up under pressure.\n\n--DIVIDER-----\n\n[\ud83c\udfe0 Home - All Lessons](https://app.readytensor.ai/hubs/ready_tensor_certifications)  \n\n[\u2b05\ufe0f Previous - Tag Extraction System](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/D3vJsJh1500g) \n[\u27a1\ufe0f Next - Introducing MCP](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/LAeGUSWv4dKb) \n\n---",
